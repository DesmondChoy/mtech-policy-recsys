# Progress: Multi-Agent System for Insurance Policy Recommendations

## Project Status: Initial Setup

The project is in its initial setup phase. We have established the directory structure and documentation foundation.

## What Works

- **Project Structure**: Basic directory structure has been created
- **Documentation**: Memory bank files have been established with initial content
- **Version Control**: Git repository is set up

## What's Left to Build

### Foundation
- [ ] Set up Python environment and dependencies
- [ ] Create initial Jupyter notebooks for experimentation
- [ ] Establish data processing utilities

### Data Collection & Processing
- [ ] Gather sample insurance policy documents
- [ ] Generate synthetic conversation transcripts
- [ ] Implement document processing functions
- [ ] Create data structures for requirements and analysis

### Agent Development
- [ ] Customer Service Agent
  - [ ] Conversation handling
  - [ ] Question generation
  - [ ] Information gathering
- [ ] Requirements Extractor
  - [ ] Key information extraction
  - [ ] Requirement prioritization
  - [ ] Structured output generation
- [ ] Policy Analyzer
  - [ ] Document parsing
  - [ ] Requirement matching
  - [ ] Relevance assessment
- [ ] Voting System
  - [ ] Parallel analysis execution
  - [ ] Result aggregation
  - [ ] Consensus determination
- [ ] Recommendation Agent
  - [ ] Result interpretation
  - [ ] Justification generation
  - [ ] Recommendation formatting

### Integration
- [ ] Pipeline construction
- [ ] Component interaction testing
- [ ] End-to-end workflow validation

### Evaluation
- [ ] Evaluation metrics definition
- [ ] Ground truth creation
- [ ] Performance measurement
- [ ] System refinement

### User Interface
- [ ] Basic web interface (if time permits)
- [ ] Email delivery system

## Known Issues

As the project is in its initial setup phase, there are no specific implementation issues yet. Anticipated challenges include:

1. **Document Processing**: Insurance policies may have varied formats and structures
2. **LLM Consistency**: Ensuring consistent outputs from Google Gemini
3. **Performance Optimization**: Managing multiple LLM calls efficiently
4. **Evaluation**: Creating accurate ground truth for recommendation quality

## Recent Milestones

- ✅ Project initialization
- ✅ Directory structure creation
- ✅ Memory bank documentation

## Upcoming Milestones

- ⬜ Environment setup
- ⬜ Initial data collection
- ⬜ First agent prototype
- ⬜ Basic pipeline implementation
- ⬜ Preliminary evaluation

## Notes

- The project will follow a notebook-first development approach
- Focus will be on experimentation and iteration rather than production-ready code
- Documentation will be continuously updated as the project progresses
