# Introduction

- This project proposes an intelligent reasoning system to address these challenges, providing personalized travel insurance recommendations using hybrid machine reasoning techniques.
- The system integrates Decision Automation, Business Resource Optimization, Knowledge Discovery, and Cognitive Techniques to deliver unbiased, transparent, and efficient recommendations.

# Project Background

- Consumers find insurance policies complex due to technical jargon, information overload, cognitive biases, emotional decision-making, and limited time for thorough comparison.
- Current market lacks personalized, transparent tools that effectively empower consumers to make informed decisions.
- Insurance companies require deeper insights into customer preferences and competitive product positioning.

# Market Research

- Existing market solutions are often biased and don't adequately address iterative refinement based on evolving customer needs.
- Personalization Of Travel Insurance Plans Are More Important For Generation Y Travelers
- Intelligent reasoning systems using LLMs have been identified as effective solutions in knowledge discovery, decision automation, and cognitive systems.

# Project Scope - Key Features

- Decision Automation (Knowledge-Based Reasoning): LLMs will analyze policies and customer conversations to extract data. An agent will apply reasoning and oversee a voting system before finalizing recommendations.
- Business Resource Optimization (Informed Search): Guided search for optimal insurance policies based on customer-defined constraints and preferences.
- Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining (Recommendation & Supervised ML): Personalized travel insurance recommendations derived from customer data and policy analysis.
- ML models trained on customer data e.g. age, gender, insurance requirements, final recommendation, to uncover critical insights on product/market positioning.
- Cognitive Techniques/Tools: Structured and dynamic knowledge bases, with transparent justification of recommendations.

# Project Scope - Technical Architecture

- Knowledge Extraction: LLM extracts key customer requirements from conversation transcripts, forming structured, prioritized customer profiles.
- Policy Reasoning: LLM analyzes and evaluates insurance policies against customer requirements, generating structured Analysis Reports.
- Voting Mechanism: Multiple asynchronous LLM calls independently recommend policies; results aggregated to ensure robust outcomes.
- Recommendation Delivery Agent: Reviews aggregated voting results and provides clearly justified recommendations via email, supporting iterative refinement through additional user interactions.
- Machine Learning: Supervised ML model is trained on a dataset augmented with final recommendations to uncover feature importance and critical insights.
- Feedback Loop: Customers can iteratively refine their initial requirements, enhancing the accuracy and personalization of subsequent recommendations.

# Data Collection and Preparation

- Structured Knowledge Base: Publicly available travel insurance policies.
- Dynamic Knowledge Base: User-generated conversation transcripts.
    - Initially synthetically generated via LLMs for diverse scenario coverage.
    - Potential inclusion of real human-AI conversational data
- Ground Truth Labels: Derived from clearly defined user needs and expected recommendation outcomes.
