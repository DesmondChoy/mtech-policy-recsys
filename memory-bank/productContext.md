## How It Should Work

The system follows a multi-agent workflow:

1. **Conversational Interface**:
   - Users interact with a Customer Service agent in natural language
   - The system guides users to express their travel insurance needs and preferences

2. **Information Extraction**:
   - An Extractor agent processes conversation transcripts
   - Key requirements are identified and structured into a customer profile

3. **Policy Analysis**:
   - An Analyzer agent evaluates insurance policies against customer requirements
   - Structured analysis reports are generated for each policy

4. **Consensus Building**:
   - Multiple independent LLM instances vote on suitable policies
   - A Voting agent aggregates results to ensure robust recommendations

5. **Recommendation Delivery**:
   - A Recommender agent reviews voting results
   - Clear, justified recommendations are provided
   - Supporting evidence links directly to policy clauses

6. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Users can update their requirements
   - The system provides refined recommendations based on feedback

7. **Machine Learning Integration**:
   - Supervised ML models analyze patterns in recommendations
   - Insights on feature importance inform future recommendations
