# Product Context: Multi-Agent System for Insurance Policy Recommendations

## Why This Project Exists

### Consumer Challenges
The insurance market presents significant challenges for consumers:
- **Overwhelming Complexity**: Insurance policies contain complex terms, conditions, and exclusions that are difficult for the average consumer to understand.
- **Information Asymmetry**: Insurers have vastly more knowledge about their products than consumers, creating an unbalanced decision-making environment.
- **Decision Fatigue**: Comparing multiple policies across different providers is mentally taxing and time-consuming.
- **Trust Issues**: Many consumers are skeptical of insurance companies and their representatives due to perceived conflicts of interest.

### Market Gap
Current solutions fall short:
- **Comparison Websites**: Often biased by commission structures and provide surface-level comparisons without deep analysis.
- **Insurance Agents**: May have conflicts of interest and typically represent a limited set of providers.
- **Direct Research**: Extremely time-consuming and requires specialized knowledge to be effective.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Simplification of Complex Information**
   - Translates technical insurance jargon into clear, understandable language
   - Extracts only the relevant information based on customer needs

2. **Objective Analysis**
   - Multi-agent voting system reduces individual biases
   - No commission-based incentives influencing recommendations

3. **Personalization at Scale**
   - Tailors recommendations to individual customer requirements
   - Adapts to changing needs through follow-up conversations

4. **Time Efficiency**
   - Reduces hours of research to a simple conversation
   - Handles the heavy lifting of policy comparison

5. **Trust Building**
   - Provides transparent justifications for recommendations
   - Links recommendations directly to policy clauses

## How It Should Work

The system is designed to mimic the best aspects of human customer service while eliminating biases and adding computational power:

1. **Natural Conversation**: Users interact with a conversational agent that feels like talking to a knowledgeable, helpful customer service representative.

2. **Intelligent Requirement Gathering**: The system asks clarifying questions to ensure it fully understands the user's needs and priorities.

3. **Behind-the-Scenes Analysis**: Multiple AI agents analyze policies against the user's specific requirements, extracting relevant information.

4. **Consensus-Based Recommendations**: A voting mechanism among multiple agents ensures more reliable recommendations.

5. **Clear Communication**: Results are presented in plain language with specific justifications linked to policy details.

6. **Iterative Refinement**: Users can provide feedback or additional requirements to refine recommendations.

## User Experience Goals

- **Effortless**: Users should feel the process is significantly easier than traditional methods.
- **Conversational**: The interaction should feel natural and human-like.
- **Educational**: Users should learn about important policy aspects relevant to their needs.
- **Empowering**: Users should feel more confident in their insurance decisions.
- **Transparent**: The reasoning behind recommendations should be clear and traceable.
- **Adaptive**: The system should accommodate changing requirements and follow-up questions.
