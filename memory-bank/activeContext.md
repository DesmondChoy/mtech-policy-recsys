# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project has moved beyond initial setup and is focused on refining the existing script-based pipelines and planning next steps. The current focus is on:

1.  **Memory Bank Update**: Aligning all Memory Bank documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) with the actual codebase and current workflow reality. **(In Progress)**
2.  **Evaluation Framework Development**: **Testing and refining** implemented evaluations (PDF extraction via `eval_pdf_extraction.py`, scenario recommendation via `evaluate_scenario_recommendations.py`) and **planning/designing** the evaluation mechanism for comparison reports (`generate_policy_comparison.py`).
3.  **Script Refinement**: Improving existing scripts based on testing and initial results (e.g., prompt engineering, error handling).
4.  **Next Phase Planning**: Defining the implementation strategy for recommendation logic and potential integration of components.

   - Created structured models for evaluation responses:
     - `CoverageEvaluation` for individual coverage evaluations
     - `EvaluationSummary` for the evaluation summary
     - `TranscriptEvaluation` as the top-level model
   - Updated the Gemini model to use the available "gemini-2.0-flash" model
   - Added fallback mechanism for handling responses without parsed attributes
   - Enhanced documentation with detailed explanation of the schema-based approach
   - Improved reliability and reduced JSON parsing errors

8. **Extractor Agent Implementation**:
   - Implemented the Extractor Agent using `crewai` framework (`src/agents/extractor.py`).
   - Defined agent role, goal, backstory, and task for extracting requirements from transcripts.
   - Utilizes the `TravelInsuranceRequirement` Pydantic model for structured JSON output.
   - Enriched the `TravelInsuranceRequirement` model (`src/utils/transcript_processing.py`) with `TravelerDetail` sub-model and `Field` descriptions (Commits a80c230, 8083da9).
   - Created a command-line runner script (`src/web/app.py`) to execute the extraction process, taking a transcript path as input and saving results to `data/extracted_customer_requirements/` (Commit 28479a4).
   - Added `crewai` to dependencies.

9. **Workflow Documentation Update**:
   - Updated `README.md` and `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` to accurately reflect the current workflow: Evaluation (`eval_transcript_main.py`) -> Parsing (potentially `transcript_processing.py`) -> Extraction (`src/agents/extractor.py`). This replaces previous references to the notebook prototype (`extractor_prototype.ipynb`) with the actual agent implementation.

10. **Policy Extraction Script**:
    - Created `scripts/extract_policy_tier.py` to automate the extraction of structured policy information from PDFs using the Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25`).
    - This script replaces the previous manual/notebook-based PDF-to-text conversion.
    - Includes Pydantic validation, API retries, and usage documentation.
    - Updated `requirements.txt` and fixed an unrelated linting error in `notebooks/agent_development/extractor/extractor_prototype.ipynb`.

11. **Extractor Agent Script Enhancement**:
    - Refactored `src/agents/extractor.py` to align with the logic prototyped in the notebook.
    - Implemented command-line argument parsing to accept the input transcript JSON path.
    - Configured the agent to use OpenAI (via `crewai` and `.env` variables: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME`).
    - Added logic to dynamically name the output file based on the input transcript (e.g., `parsed_transcript_01_requirements.json`).
    - Ensured output is saved correctly to the `data/extracted_customer_requirements/` directory.
    - Fixed JSON serialization error by converting the Pydantic model output to a dictionary using `.model_dump()` before saving.

12. **Personality Data Generation Script**:
    - Created `scripts/data_generation/generate_personalities.py` to generate a list of 10 common customer service personality types using Gemini (`gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25`).
    - The script uses Pydantic for validation and saves the output to `data/transcripts/personalities.json`.
    - Added documentation (docstring) to the script explaining its purpose and usage.

13. **Transcript Generation Script**:
    - Created `scripts/data_generation/generate_transcripts.py` to automate the generation of synthetic transcripts using Gemini (`gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25`).
    - The script uses `data/transcripts/personalities.json` and `data/coverage_requirements/coverage_requirements.py` as inputs.
    - It includes command-line arguments (`-n`) to specify the number of transcripts to generate.
    - The output is saved as structured JSON (list of speaker turns) in `data/transcripts/raw/synthetic/` with timestamped filenames (`transcript_{personality}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.json`).
    - Includes parsing logic and fallback for raw text saving if parsing fails.

14. **Transcript Processing Enhancements (`src/utils/transcript_processing.py`)**:
    - Modified `parse_transcript` function to handle both `.txt` (original format) and the new nested `.json` format (from `generate_transcripts.py`). It now extracts the relevant `transcript` list from JSON files.
    - Updated the `main` function to perform batch processing: it iterates through all `.txt` and `.json` files in `data/transcripts/raw/synthetic/` and saves the parsed output (JSON list) to `data/transcripts/processed/` with a `parsed_` prefix.

15. **Extractor Agent Batch Processing & Filename Update (`src/agents/extractor.py`)**:
    - Modified the `main` function to perform batch processing: it iterates through all `.json` files in the input directory (defaulting to `data/transcripts/processed/`) and runs the extractor agent on each.
    - Changed the output filename format saved to `data/extracted_customer_requirements/` to `requirements_{original_name_part}.json` (e.g., `requirements_the_anxious_inquirer_20250403_152253.json`).
    - Added a comprehensive docstring explaining the script's purpose, usage, I/O, dependencies, and arguments.

16. **Transcript Evaluation Parser Update**:
    - Modified `scripts/evaluation/processors/eval_transcript_parser.py` to exclusively handle JSON-formatted raw transcripts (output from `generate_transcripts.py`). Removed support for `.txt` format.
    - Updated `find_transcript_files` to search only for `.json` files.
    - Updated `parse_transcript` to load JSON and extract the conversation list from the `"transcript"` key.
    - Updated the docstring and argument help text in `scripts/evaluation/eval_transcript_main.py` to reflect the change to JSON-only input.

17. **Coverage Requirements & Transcript Generation Update**:
    - Modified `data/coverage_requirements/coverage_requirements.py`:
        - Renamed/removed existing coverage keys to: `medical_coverage`, `trip_cancellation`, `travel_delays`, `lost_damaged_luggage`.
        - Added new coverage keys: `sports_adventure`, `war_cover` with detailed content.
        - Retained `customer_context_options` dictionary and helper functions.
    - Modified `scripts/data_generation/generate_transcripts.py`:
        - Imported `get_customer_context_options`.
        - Updated prompt template to include a placeholder for context options.
        - Added logic to load and format `customer_context_options` for inclusion in the final prompt.

18. **Transcript Generation Prompt Refinement (`scripts/data_generation/generate_transcripts.py`)**:
    - Iteratively refined the `PROMPT_TEMPLATE` to improve coverage of requirements and context points in generated transcripts.
    - Clarified instructions regarding agent vs. customer initiation of topics (agent probes context, customer raises specific coverage needs).
    - Updated section headers for clarity (e.g., `# Required Customer Context Points`).
    - Merged `# Context and Guidelines`, `# Requirements for Transcript`, and `# Pre-Output Check` into a single `# Transcript Generation Guidelines and Requirements` section for better structure and reduced redundancy.

19. **Transcript Generation Debugging & Enhancement**:
    - Added logging to `scripts/data_generation/generate_transcripts.py` to print the full prompt used for generation.
    - Added logging to print the raw text response from the LLM before parsing, aiding in debugging truncation issues.
    - Identified potential transcript truncation due to default LLM `max_output_tokens` limit.
    - Modified `src/models/llm_service.py` to accept an optional `max_output_tokens` parameter in `generate_content`.
    - Updated the call in `scripts/data_generation/generate_transcripts.py` to pass `max_output_tokens=10000` to potentially resolve truncation.

20. **Gemini Configuration Centralization & Refactoring**:
    - Updated `src/models/gemini_config.py` to set the default model to `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25` and default `max_output_tokens` to `10000`.
    - Enhanced `src/models/llm_service.py` to support multi-modal `contents` input in `generate_content`.
    - Refactored several scripts (`scripts/extract_policy_tier.py`, `scripts/evaluation/evaluators/eval_transcript_gemini.py`, `scripts/data_generation/generate_personalities.py`) to use the centralized `LLMService` instead of direct `google.generativeai` calls, leveraging the central configuration and retry logic.
    - Removed redundant `max_output_tokens` override from `scripts/data_generation/generate_transcripts.py` as it now matches the default.
    - Updated Memory Bank documentation (`techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect these changes.

21. **Policy Comparison Report Script**:
    - Created `scripts/generate_policy_comparison.py` to generate Markdown reports comparing customer requirements (from extracted JSON) against multiple processed policy JSON files.
    - Uses the centralized `LLMService` (`gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25`) and processes policies asynchronously in batches.
    - Saves reports to `results/{customer_id}_{timestamp}/`.
    - Fixed initial `KeyError` related to prompt formatting.
    - Added customer summary and description to the report output.

22. **Policy Extraction Refinement (`scripts/extract_policy_tier.py`)**:
    - Updated Pydantic models (`CoverageDetail`, added `SourceDetail`, `ConditionalLimit`) to support a more granular extraction structure.
    - Modified the `PROMPT_TEMPLATE` to instruct the LLM to:
        - Consolidate information for a single conceptual benefit into one `coverage` object.
        - Extract standard limits into `base_limits`.
        - Extract conditional limits (e.g., for add-ons) into an optional `conditional_limits` list, including the condition and source.
        - Extract specific detail snippets and their corresponding source locations into a `source_specific_details` list.
    - Updated prompt examples to reflect the new structure.

23. **Transcript Generation Scenario Support**:
    - Enhanced `scripts/data_generation/generate_transcripts.py` to support scenario-based transcript generation.
    - Created a new directory structure (`data/scenarios/`) to store scenario definitions.
    - Implemented a JSON-based scenario format with fields for scenario name, description, additional requirements, and prompt instructions.
    - Created four scenario files for testing specific coverage types:
      - `uncovered_cancellation_reason.json`: Tests coverage for trip cancellation due to personal family events.
      - `pet_care_coverage.json`: Tests coverage for pet accommodation costs during travel delays.
      - `golf_coverage.json`: Tests comprehensive golf-related coverage.
      - `public_transport_double_cover.json`: Tests doubled accidental death coverage on public transport.
    - Added a new command-line argument (`--scenario` or `-s`) to specify which scenario to use.
    - Modified the prompt template to include scenario-specific requirements and instructions.
    - Updated the output JSON to include scenario information.
    - Changed the output filename format to `transcript_{scenario_name_or_no_scenario}_{customer_id}.json` (using "no_scenario" if no scenario is specified, and replacing the timestamp with a UUID).
    - Updated script documentation to explain the new feature.

24. **Transcript Evaluation Scenario Handling & Refactoring**:
    - Updated `scripts/data_generation/generate_transcripts.py` to always include a `"scenario": null` key in the output JSON when no scenario is specified, ensuring consistent file structure.
    - Refactored the transcript evaluation scripts:
        - Moved all related Python files (`eval_transcript_main.py`, `eval_transcript_gemini.py`, `eval_transcript_parser.py`, `eval_transcript_prompts.py`, `eval_transcript_results.py`, `eval_transcript_utils.py`) into a single flat directory: `scripts/evaluation/transcript_evaluation/`.
        - Updated import statements within these files to use relative imports.
        - Deleted the old `scripts/evaluation/evaluators/`, `processors/`, `prompts/`, and `utils/` subdirectories.
    - Enhanced the evaluation system to handle scenario-based transcripts:
        - Modified `eval_transcript_parser.py` to extract the scenario name from the transcript JSON.
        - Modified `eval_transcript_prompts.py` to include scenario-specific requirements in the evaluation prompt.
        - Modified `eval_transcript_main.py` to load scenario requirements and pass them to the prompt constructor.
    - Improved JSON parsing robustness in `src/models/llm_service.py` (`generate_structured_content` method) to handle markdown code blocks and attempt to fix common formatting errors (like missing commas) before parsing.
    - Updated `README.md` with the new evaluation script location and usage instructions.

25. **Filename Standardization for Processed/Extracted Files**:
    - Modified `src/utils/transcript_processing.py` to generate output files in `data/transcripts/processed/` with the format `parsed_transcript_{scenario_name}_{uuid}.json`, extracting the scenario and UUID from the raw input filename.
    - Confirmed that `src/agents/extractor.py` correctly parses this new input format and generates output files in `data/extracted_customer_requirements/` with the format `requirements_{scenario_name}_{uuid}.json`.
    - Updated `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` and `memory-bank/techContext.md` to reflect these standardized filename formats.

26. **Insurer-Level Policy Comparison Refactoring (`scripts/generate_policy_comparison.py`)**:
    - Refactored the script to perform insurer-level analysis instead of tier-level.
    - Updated input handling to accept `--customer_id` (UUID) and dynamically find requirements and policy files.
    - Implemented logic to group policies by insurer and use `tier_rankings.py`.
    - Created a new detailed prompt (`PROMPT_TEMPLATE_INSURER`) instructing the LLM to:
        - Select the single best tier per insurer using holistic analysis and price tie-breaking.
        - Provide justification.
        - Perform a detailed requirement-by-requirement analysis for the chosen tier, including granular source details.
        - Include a summary of strengths and weaknesses.
    - Updated output handling to save reports to `results/{uuid}/policy_comparison_report_{insurer}_{uuid}.md`.
    - Incorporated asynchronous processing for insurers.
    - Fixed `KeyError` issues related to prompt formatting placeholders by escaping them (`{{Requirement Name}}`, `{{Recommended Tier Name}}`).
27. **PDF Extraction Evaluation Script**:
    - Created `scripts/evaluation/pdf_extraction_evaluation/eval_pdf_extraction.py` to compare processed policy JSON against the source PDF using a multi-modal LLM (`LLMService`).
    - Implements two-way verification (JSON vs. PDF, PDF vs. JSON).
    - Renamed directory and script from `policy_extraction_evaluation` to `pdf_extraction_evaluation`.
    - Updated associated plan document (`memory-bank/major_changes/pdf_to_json_eval.md`).
28. **Recommendation Report Script Revision (Hybrid Approach)**:
    - Updated `scripts/generate_recommendation_report.py` based on revised plan (`memory-bank/major_changes/recommender_logic.md`).
    - Includes:
        - Task 4: Updated Stage 2 prompt (`PROMPT_TEMPLATE_STAGE2`) to request source references in justification.
        - Task 5: Ensured `main` function returns Stage 1 & Stage 2 results.
        - Task 6: Implemented Markdown report generation (`generate_markdown_report`) including justification, Stage 1 ranking, scoring explanation, and saving to `recommendation_report_{uuid}.md`. (Note: Intermediate JSON output was removed).
        - Task 7: Added unit tests for Markdown report generation to `tests/test_generate_recommendation_report.py`.
    - Updated associated plan document (`memory-bank/major_changes/recommender_logic.md`) marking tasks 4, 5, 6, 7 complete.
29. **PDF Extraction Evaluation Script Enhancement**:
    - Modified `scripts/evaluation/pdf_extraction_evaluation/eval_pdf_extraction.py` to include a `--file_pattern` command-line argument.
    - This allows specifying a glob pattern (e.g., `"gels_*.json"`) to filter the input JSON files processed by the script, defaulting to `*.json` if not provided.
    - Successfully tested the script by running it with `--file_pattern "gels_*.json"`.
30. **Orchestration Script Debugging & Refinement**:
    - Investigated inconsistent results (missing evaluations, missing/incomplete comparison reports) when running `scripts/orchestrate_scenario_evaluation.py`.
    - Identified root causes:
        - Sequential transcript evaluation causing single failures to halt evaluation for that transcript.
        - High concurrency (orchestrator parallel UUIDs + comparison script parallel insurers) likely exceeding LLM API rate limits, causing intermittent comparison report failures.
    - Implemented fixes:
        - Refactored `scripts/evaluation/transcript_evaluation/eval_transcript_main.py` to support single-file processing with exit codes.
        - Modified `scripts/orchestrate_scenario_evaluation.py` to run transcript evaluations in parallel per file.
        - Modified `scripts/orchestrate_scenario_evaluation.py` to run report generation (comparison + recommendation) sequentially per UUID, reducing peak API load.
        - Added detailed logging around LLM calls in `scripts/generate_policy_comparison.py`.
    - Updated the orchestration implementation plan (`memory-bank/major_changes/orchestration_script_implementation_plan.md`) to reflect changes and mark steps complete.
    - Confirmed successful run of the updated orchestrator script.

31. **Onboarding Instructions Update**:
    - Onboarding/setup instructions updated: README and Memory Bank now specify that new users must run `npm install` after cloning to install Node.js dependencies.

32. **Recommendation Report Script Enhancement (Transcript Context)**:
    - Modified `scripts/generate_recommendation_report.py` to incorporate the parsed customer transcript into the Stage 2 LLM re-ranking prompt (`PROMPT_TEMPLATE_STAGE2`).
    - Updated the `run_stage2_reranking` function to load, format, and pass the transcript data.
    - Updated the prompt instructions to guide the LLM on using transcript cues for prioritization.
    - **Revision:** Subsequently removed the loading and usage of the extracted requirements summary (`json_dict`) from the Stage 2 prompt and logic, simplifying the context to focus solely on the transcript and comparison reports.
33. **Recommendation Report Script Efficiency & Logging (`scripts/generate_recommendation_report.py`)**:
    - Added `--overwrite` flag handling logic.
    - Moved the check for existing report files *before* Stage 1/Stage 2 processing to prevent unnecessary LLM calls when `overwrite=False` (default).
    - Corrected the return value logic in `run_single_customer` to accurately reflect skipped processing in the batch summary.
    - Updated batch summary logging messages for clarity (`Failed or Skipped`).
    - Updated script docstrings (`argparse` help text and main docstring) to clearly state default argument behaviors.
34. **Orchestration Script Evaluation Scope (`scripts/orchestrate_scenario_evaluation.py`)**:
    - Modified the final evaluation step (`aggregate_and_filter_evaluations`) to remove filtering based on current run UUIDs.
    - The script now saves the complete evaluation results for *all* recommendation reports found for a given scenario at the time of execution.
    - Updated the output filename format for this final evaluation step to `results_{scenario}_all_transcripts_{run_timestamp}.json`.
35. **Orchestration Script Enhancement (`--only_aggregate`)**:
    - Added an `--only_aggregate` command-line flag to `scripts/orchestrate_scenario_evaluation.py`.
    - When this flag is used, the script skips steps 1-3 (transcript generation, pipeline processing, report generation) and proceeds directly to step 4 (final evaluation and aggregation) using the `TARGET_SCENARIOS` list.

36. **Scenario Evaluation Ground Truth Refinement (`uncovered_cancellation_reason`)**:
    - Analyzed all 12 failing customer IDs for the `uncovered_cancellation_reason` scenario.
    - Identified a consistent pattern: the system recommended valid alternative policies (GELS Gold, FWD Business/First) offering the required partial coverage (TIAR/CFAR) but these were not the exact tiers listed in the original ground truth (GELS Platinum/FWD Premium).
    - Concluded the ground truth was too strict, leading to an artificially low pass rate (40%).
    - Updated `data/evaluation/scenario_evaluation/scenario_ground_truth.json` to include GELS Gold, FWD Business, and FWD First as acceptable `expected_policies` for this scenario, relaxing the definition for a more accurate evaluation.
37. **Ground Truth Evaluation Feature Integration (Merge `GroundTruth` branch - `cc4a2d7`)**:
    - Renamed `data/coverages.json` to `data/ground_truth/ground_truth.json` and significantly refined its structure and content (atomizing requirements, merging duplicates, etc.).
    - Added `src/embedding/embedding_utils.py` containing the `EmbeddingMatcher` class, which uses OpenAI embeddings and hybrid matching strategies to compare queries against ground truth keys.
    - Added embedding caching mechanism to `src/embedding/cache/`.
    - Added `scripts/generate_ground_truth_coverage.py` script to evaluate recommendations against the ground truth file using the embedding utilities.
   - Updated `scripts/evaluation/scenario_evaluation/evaluate_scenario_recommendations.py` to utilize these embedding utilities for more robust evaluation.
38. **Netlify Frontend Deployment Debugging**:
    - Investigated Netlify deployment failures for the `ux-webapp` frontend.
    - Corrected `netlify.toml` build command to `cd ux-webapp && npm install && npm run build` to ensure execution in the correct directory and installation of Node.js dependencies.
    - Removed invalid version pin for `crewai` in root `requirements.txt` to allow Netlify's Python dependency installation step to pass (even though Python isn't strictly needed for the frontend build itself).
    - Updated `ux-webapp/package.json`'s `build` script to include execution of `sync-public-assets.cjs` (`node ./scripts/sync-public-assets.cjs && tsc -b && vite build`) to ensure necessary data files (`results/`, `data/extracted_customer_requirements/`, etc.) are copied to `ux-webapp/public/` before the Vite build, making them available in the deployed site.
    - Guided user to update Netlify site settings to deploy from the `main` branch instead of the old `ux` branch.
    - Successfully deployed the frontend application to Netlify.
39. **Frontend Landing Page Demo Dropdown**: Modified `ux-webapp/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` to remove the `isDemo` condition, making the demo customer ID dropdown always visible, including in production builds.
40. **Frontend Report Viewer Fixes & Enhancements**:
    - **Dynamic Insurer Dropdown**: Modified `ux-webapp/scripts/sync-public-assets.cjs` to generate an `index.json` listing available reports within each `results/{uuid}/` directory. Updated `ux-webapp/src/pages/ReportViewerPage.tsx` to remove hardcoded insurers. Updated `ux-webapp/src/components/TabbedReportView.tsx` to fetch the `index.json`, dynamically populate the insurer dropdown based on available reports, and handle loading/error states.
    - **Comparison Report Path Fix**: Corrected the path construction in `TabbedReportView.tsx` for the policy comparison report to include the UUID (`policy_comparison_report_{insurer}_{uuid}.md`), resolving the issue where it previously loaded `index.html`.
    - **Requirements/Transcript Path Fix**: Updated `TabbedReportView.tsx` to fetch the `transcripts_index.json`, extract the scenario name for the current UUID, and use it to construct the correct paths for the requirements (`requirements_{scenario_name}_{uuid}.json`) and transcript (`parsed_transcript_{scenario_name}_{uuid}.json`) files, resolving loading errors.
    - **Requirements Display**: Modified `ux-webapp/src/components/JsonPrettyViewer.tsx` to accept an optional `dataPath` prop. Updated `TabbedReportView.tsx` to pass `dataPath="json_dict"` so the "Customer Requirements" tab displays only the nested `json_dict` object.
    - **Transcript Display**: Created a new component `ux-webapp/src/components/TranscriptViewer.tsx` to fetch and render the transcript JSON using the existing `ChatBubble` component. Updated `TabbedReportView.tsx` to use this component for the "Transcript" tab.
    - **Markdown Animation**: Modified `ux-webapp/src/components/MarkdownRenderer.tsx` to support different animation modes (`character`, `paragraph`, `none`) via an `animationMode` prop. Updated `TabbedReportView.tsx` to use `'character'` mode (fast chunking) for the "Recommendation" tab and `'paragraph'` mode for the "Policy Comparison" tab. Adjusted animation speed calculation for faster rendering.
41. **Frontend Landing Page Mobile Dropdown Fix**: Refactored `ux-webapp/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` to move the demo customer ID dropdown from a fixed position (which was off-screen on mobile) to be part of the main card's layout flow, ensuring visibility on all screen sizes. Initially placed inside `CardContent`, then moved above the `Card` within a new flex container based on user feedback.
42. **Frontend Landing Page Text Updates**: Modified text content in `ux-webapp/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx`:
    - Updated tagline to "Travel Insurance Made Simple. Finally.".
    - Removed default helper text from the Customer ID input field.
    - Replaced the caption below the "Continue" button with two separate lines: "Your Perfect Trip Deserves Perfect Coverage." and "Login To View Your Personalized Report.".
43. **Frontend Rebranding to Aegis AI**:
    - Updated the HTML title in `ux-webapp/index.html` to "Aegis AI".
    - Changed the main title in `ux-webapp/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` from "TravelSafe Recommender System" to "Aegis AI".
    - Replaced the `FlightTakeoffIcon` with a custom image (`/assets/aegis-shield.jpeg`) in `ux-webapp/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx`. Ensured the image path was corrected from `.jpg` to `.jpeg`.
    - Updated the copyright notice in `ux-webapp/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` to "© [Year] Aegis AI. Powered by AI Reasoning System.".
44. **Frontend Report Viewer TOC & UI Polish**:
    - Implemented dynamic Table of Contents (TOC) for Markdown views (`Recommendation`, `Policy Comparison`) using `rehype-slug` and a custom `remark-extract-headings` plugin (`ux-webapp/src/lib/remark-extract-headings.ts`).
    - Created `ux-webapp/src/components/TableOfContents.tsx` to display the TOC.
    - Integrated TOC into `ux-webapp/src/components/TabbedReportView.tsx`, handling responsive display (desktop sidebar, mobile drawer).
    - Debugged and resolved issues related to React component lifecycle and state updates causing TOC instability (using debouncing in `TabbedReportView.tsx` and simplified callback logic in `ux-webapp/src/components/MarkdownRenderer.tsx`).
    - Relocated the mobile TOC toggle button from the AppBar to be next to the insurer dropdown on the "Policy Comparison" tab for better context.
    - Changed the "Switch Customer" button text in the `TabbedReportView` AppBar to "Log out".
45. **Frontend Netlify Build Fix (TOC Plugin)**:
    - Resolved persistent `TS2307: Cannot find module` errors during Netlify builds related to the `remark-extract-headings` plugin.
    - Moved `remark-extract-headings.ts` from `src/lib/` to `src/components/`.
    - Updated import paths in `MarkdownRenderer.tsx`, `TabbedReportView.tsx`, and `TableOfContents.tsx` to use the new relative path (`./remark-extract-headings`).
    - Deleted the original file from `src/lib/`. This resolved path resolution issues encountered by `tsc -b` in the Netlify environment.
46. **Frontend Disclaimer Page**:
    - Created a new page component `ux-webapp/src/pages/DisclaimerPage.tsx` to display a disclaimer message about AI-generated reports.
    - Added a route `/disclaimer/:uuid` in `ux-webapp/src/App.tsx` pointing to the new page.
    - Modified `ux-webapp/src/pages/TransitionPage.tsx` to navigate to `/disclaimer/:uuid` after the loading phases, instead of directly to `/report/:uuid`.
    - The `DisclaimerPage` includes "I understand" (navigates to `/report/:uuid`) and "Log out" (navigates to `/`) buttons.
47. **Frontend Feedback Components**:
    - Created `ux-webapp/src/components/FeedbackButtons.tsx` with thumbs up/down icons, state management, and subtle click animation. Centered alignment.
    - Created `ux-webapp/src/components/FeedbackTabContent.tsx` with description, styled predefined feedback buttons (chip-style, blue background, normal case, left-aligned), text area, and non-functional "Send" button with confirmation snackbar. Description text split into two lines.
    - Integrated `FeedbackButtons` into existing tabs (`Recommendation`, `Policy Comparison`, `Customer Requirements`, `Transcript`) in `ux-webapp/src/components/TabbedReportView.tsx`.
    - Added a new "Feedback" tab to `TabbedReportView.tsx` rendering `FeedbackTabContent`.
48. **Frontend Tab Scrolling Fix**: Modified `ux-webapp/src/components/TabbedReportView.tsx` to make the main tabs always scrollable (`variant="scrollable"`) and always display labels, fixing label cutoff issues.

## Next Steps (Revised Focus)

1.  **Implement Comparison Report Evaluation**:
    *   Design the evaluation methodology for the Markdown reports generated by `scripts/generate_policy_comparison.py`.
    *   Implement the corresponding evaluation script/process.
    *   Define metrics for assessing report quality, accuracy of tier selection, and justification clarity. *(Implementation pending)*
2.  **ML Model Development (Later Phase)**:
    *   Plan dataset preparation and outline initial goals for ML models. *(Future)*
3.  **Define Future Architecture**:
    *   Solidify the architectural plan based on performance and integration needs, considering script-based vs. agent-based approaches. *(Ongoing)*
4.  **Frontend Maintenance & Monitoring**:
    *   Monitor the deployed frontend, ensure the `sync-public-assets.cjs` script functions correctly in the build pipeline, and address any regressions or new issues. *(Ongoing Maintenance)*

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1.  **LLM Selection & Configuration**:
    *   Continue primary use of Google Gemini via `LLMService` for most tasks due to centralized control and features.
    *   Maintain OpenAI via `crewai` for the Extractor Agent, but monitor performance and cost implications. Consider potential future migration to `LLMService` if feasible within `crewai` or if the agent is refactored.
    *   Refine default parameters in `gemini_config.py` as needed based on ongoing testing.

2.  **Architecture Strategy**:
    *   The current architecture is script-heavy with only one agent (`Extractor` using `crewai`/OpenAI).
    *   Need to decide whether to:
        *   Continue with a primarily script-based workflow.
        *   Implement future logic (Recommender) as simple scripts or agents.
        *   Adopt `crewai` (or another framework) more broadly if complex agent interactions become necessary.

3.  **Data Representation**:
    *   Continue using Pydantic models (`TravelInsuranceRequirement`, policy extraction schemas) for structured JSON validation and clarity.
    *   Define schema for final recommendation output.
    *   Refine existing schemas based on extraction/comparison needs and edge cases encountered.

4.  **Evaluation Metrics & Strategy**:
    *   Define specific, measurable metrics for the *planned* policy extraction and comparison report evaluations (e.g., F1 score for specific field extraction, ROUGE score for summary quality, human rating for justification clarity).
    *   Determine how evaluation results will feedback into prompt/logic refinement.

5.  **User Experience (Developer vs. End-User)**:
    *   Current UX is developer-focused (running scripts).
    *   If end-user interaction is a future goal, decisions are needed on the interface (conversational AI vs. GUI) and how to integrate it with the backend logic.
    *   Focus comparison report (`generate_policy_comparison.py`) output on clarity and justification for potential end-user consumption, even if delivered via script currently.

6.  **Integration & Orchestration**:
    *   Decide on the mechanism for connecting the different processing steps (manual script execution, simple chaining script, workflow engine, `crewai` crew). This impacts maintainability and ease of execution.

7.  **Deployment Strategy**:
    *   Current execution via CLI scripts is suitable for development.
    *   **Frontend Deployment (Netlify)**: The `ux-webapp` frontend is successfully deployed to Netlify. Configuration requires:
        *   `netlify.toml` build command: `cd ux-webapp && npm install && npm run build`
        *   `netlify.toml` publish directory: `ux-webapp/dist`
        *   `ux-webapp/package.json` build script includes asset sync: `node ./scripts/sync-public-assets.cjs && tsc -b && vite build`
        *   Netlify site configured to deploy the correct branch (e.g., `main`).
    *   **Backend Deployment**: Not currently deployed. Runs locally via Python scripts. Future deployment needs consideration (Docker, Cloud Functions, etc.).

## Current Challenges

1.  **LLM Accuracy & Consistency**: Ensuring high accuracy and consistent formatting from LLMs remains an ongoing effort, particularly for complex extraction and comparison tasks. *(Ongoing)*
2.  **Evaluation Gaps**: The lack of automated evaluation for *comparison report* quality is the primary remaining evaluation gap, hindering rapid iteration on that specific component. *(Partially Addressed - Other Evals Considered Complete)*
3.  **Integration & Orchestration Management**: Managing dependencies, potential failures, and overall runtime within the current orchestration script (`scripts/orchestrate_scenario_evaluation.py`) requires ongoing monitoring and maintenance. *(Ongoing Management)*
4.  **Dual LLM Dependency**: Reliance on both OpenAI (Extractor Agent via CrewAI, EmbeddingMatcher) and Google Gemini (LLMService) adds complexity (config, cost, maintenance). *(Ongoing)*
5.  **Synthetic Data Limitations**: Generated transcripts might not fully capture real-world complexities or edge cases, potentially limiting the robustness of downstream components and evaluations. *(Ongoing)*
6.  **Performance Optimization**: Latency of multiple LLM calls in the orchestrated workflow needs monitoring, especially if scaling up the number of scenarios or policies. *(Ongoing)*
7.  **Frontend Data Sync & Maintenance**: Ensuring the data sync script runs reliably during deployment and maintaining the stability of frontend components requires ongoing attention. *(Ongoing Maintenance)*
8.  **Frontend Styling Refinements**: Address any minor styling inconsistencies or improvements identified during testing (e.g., feedback button alignment/wrapping). *(Ongoing Maintenance)*
