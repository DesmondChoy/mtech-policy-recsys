# Active Context: Multi-Agent System for Insurance Policy Recommendations

## Current Work Focus

The project is in its initial setup phase. We have established the directory structure and are preparing the foundation for development. The current focus is on:

1. **Project Structure Setup**: Creating the necessary directories and files for organized development.
2. **Documentation**: Establishing comprehensive documentation in the memory bank to guide development.
3. **Environment Preparation**: Setting up the development environment for the project.

## Recent Changes

- Created the initial project directory structure
- Established memory bank documentation
- Set up placeholder files for future development

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Data Collection/Generation**:
   - Gather sample insurance policy documents
   - Create synthetic conversation transcripts for testing

2. **Exploratory Analysis**:
   - Analyze insurance policy structures
   - Experiment with Google Gemini API for conversation handling

3. **Agent Prototyping**:
   - Develop initial prototype of the Customer Service agent
   - Experiment with requirements extraction from conversations

### Short-term Goals
1. **Core Component Development**:
   - Implement basic versions of all agents
   - Create data processing pipelines

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test interactions between components
   - Validate the end-to-end workflow

3. **Evaluation Framework**:
   - Develop metrics for system performance
   - Create ground truth labels for testing

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Multi-Agent Approach**: Confirmed the use of specialized agents rather than a monolithic system
- **Notebook-First Development**: Agreed to develop and test in Jupyter notebooks before migrating to Python modules
- **Google Gemini Integration**: Selected as the primary LLM for all components

### Open Questions
- What format should we use for storing and processing insurance policies?
- How should we structure the synthetic conversation data?
- What level of detail should be included in customer requirements?
- How many parallel LLM calls are optimal for the voting system?

### Current Challenges
- Defining the optimal prompts for each agent
- Determining the best approach for policy document processing
- Balancing system complexity with academic project constraints

## Development Priorities

1. **Functionality**: Focus on core functionality before optimization
2. **Experimentation**: Prioritize experimentation and learning
3. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation throughout development
4. **Modularity**: Ensure components can be developed and tested independently

## Team Coordination

As this is an academic project, coordination involves:
- Regular progress tracking
- Clear documentation of decisions and findings
- Organized codebase with consistent patterns
- Jupyter notebooks for sharing experiments and results

## Current Environment

- Development is taking place in a Python environment
- Google Gemini API will be used for LLM capabilities
- Jupyter notebooks are the primary development environment
- Git is used for version control
