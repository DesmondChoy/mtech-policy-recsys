*   **Medical Expenses:** Coverage for the pre-existing condition (Asthma) needs verification.
*   **Trip Cancellation:** The specific definition of covered "unforeseen circumstances" for cancellation (especially regarding family emergencies) needs verification.
*   **War or Political Unrest:** Coverage extends to terrorism, but the full scope regarding broader political unrest or war requires clarification from the full policy document.
