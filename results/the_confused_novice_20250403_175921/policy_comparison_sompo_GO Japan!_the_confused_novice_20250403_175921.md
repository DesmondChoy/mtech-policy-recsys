    *   **Source:** [Page 2, GO Japan! Peace of mind & 24-Hour Medical Assistance sections, Sompo Insurance Singapore_GO Japan! document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Certain
*   **Justification:** The policy explicitly covers "Medical Expenses Incurred Overseas" and "Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation". Crucially, the Evacuation section mentions coverage for pre-existing medical conditions (like the customer's asthma) up to specific sub-limits (SGD 100,000 for evacuation for under 70s). The policy also offers cashless services in Japan and follow-up treatment in Singapore, directly addressing the customer's needs. Note: General Medical Expenses (Section 2) might have exclusions for pre-existing conditions unless life-threatening; the customer should verify the exact terms for asthma treatment under this section. Evacuation due to pre-existing conditions is explicitly covered up to a limit.

## Customer Requirement: Trip Cancellation

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

    *   **Source:** [Page 4, Section 16, Sompo Insurance Singapore_GO Japan! document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Certain (with caveat)
*   **Justification:** The policy explicitly includes "Trip Cancellation or Postponement" coverage. The customer mentioned cancellation due to a "family emergency". Whether this specific reason is covered depends on the policy's definition of "Insured Events" for cancellation (typically includes death, serious injury/sickness of the insured, travel companion, or immediate family member, but the exact definition needs verification in the policy wording). Financial collapse is also covered as a reason.

    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Section 30, Sompo Insurance Singapore_GO Japan! document]

### Match Certainty

    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Section 23, Sompo Insurance Singapore_GO Japan! document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The policy explicitly provides "Full Terrorism Cover" (up to an aggregate limit) and extends Personal Accident cover for "War" (as an innocent bystander). It also covers disruptions due to "strike, riot, civil commotion" under specific benefits like Alternative Travel Arrangement and Loss of Hotel Facilities. However, the broad term "political unrest" used by the customer may encompass situations not explicitly named (e.g., widespread protests not classified as riots, government travel advisories short of war/terrorism declarations). While the policy covers key aspects like terrorism and war risks, it might not cover *all* scenarios potentially falling under "political unrest". The customer should review the policy definitions and exclusions related to these events.

---

## Summary of Unmatched Requirements

*   All customer requirements listed in `insurance_coverage_type` had at least one potential policy coverage match identified. However, the match for "War or Political Unrest" is uncertain, as the policy covers specific events (Terrorism, War, Riot, Strike, Civil Commotion) but may not cover all interpretations of "political unrest". Additionally, while Medical Expenses are covered, the specifics of non-emergency coverage for pre-existing conditions like asthma under Section 2 (Medical Expenses Overseas) should be verified by the customer in the detailed policy wording.
