## Customer Requirement: Sports and Adventure Activities

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Medical expenses incurred overseas
    *   **Category:** Protecting you and your health
    *   **Limits:** (See 'Medical Expenses' section above for full limits)
    *   **Details:** Reimburses reasonable and necessary costs for medical treatment received overseas due to an *unexpected illness or injury* suffered during the trip... (See 'Medical Expenses' section above for full details). *Note: Standard exclusions might apply to hazardous activities, but skiing is not explicitly mentioned as excluded in the provided details.*
    *   **Source:** [Page 7 (Table), Page 19 (Details), Fwd_First document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Personal accident
    *   **Category:** Protecting you and your health
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Adult below 70 years of age: 400000

    *   **Source:** [Page 7 (Table), Pages 16, 18 (Details), Fwd_First document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Sports equipment protector (Optional Cover)
    *   **Category:** Optional Covers

    *   **Source:** [Page 9 (Table), Pages 28-29 (Details), Fwd_First document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The customer requires cover specifically for *injuries* during skiing. The policy provides general "Medical expenses incurred overseas" and "Personal accident" cover for unexpected injuries. However, the provided policy snippets do *not* explicitly confirm or deny coverage for injuries sustained while participating in adventurous activities like skiing. Standard travel insurance policies often have exclusions for hazardous sports unless specifically covered or an add-on is purchased. While not explicitly excluded here, the absence of confirmation creates uncertainty. The "Sports equipment protector" is an optional add-on covering the *equipment* itself (skis, etc.) against theft/damage/loss, but explicitly *excludes* damage occurring while in use, and does not cover personal injury. Further clarification on hazardous activity exclusions within the main medical/accident benefits would be needed.

## Summary of Unmatched Requirements

*   All customer requirements listed in `insurance_coverage_type` had at least one potential policy coverage match identified. However, specific attention should be paid to:
    *   **Pre-existing condition (Asthma):** Requires purchasing the **optional** "Pre-existing medical conditions" cover.
    *   **Sports Activities (Skiing Injury):** Coverage for injuries sustained *during* skiing under the standard Medical/Accident benefits is **uncertain** based on the provided details, as specific exclusions for hazardous activities are not listed but may apply. The optional "Sports equipment protector" only covers the equipment, not injuries during use.
