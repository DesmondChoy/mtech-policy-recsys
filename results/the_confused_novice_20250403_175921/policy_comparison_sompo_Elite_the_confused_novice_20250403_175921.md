    *   **Source:** [Page 3, Section 7, Sompo Insurance_Elite document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The policy provides extensive medical coverage, including high limits for overseas expenses, follow-up treatment in Singapore, evacuation, and hospital allowances. However, the customer specifically mentioned needing cover for a pre-existing condition (asthma). While the "Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation" section explicitly covers pre-existing conditions up to a certain limit for evacuation purposes, the main "Medical Expenses Incurred Overseas" section details do not explicitly mention coverage for pre-existing conditions. Standard travel insurance often excludes pre-existing conditions unless specifically stated or an add-on is purchased. Further clarification from the full policy wording or provider is needed to confirm if general medical expenses related to asthma are covered.

## Customer Requirement: Trip Cancellation

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Trip Cancellation or Postponement
    *   **Category:** Inconvenience / Liability Covers
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Per Insured Person: SGD 15,000
        *   Per Family: SGD 25,000
    *   **Details:** Covers loss of irrecoverable travel deposits or charges paid in advance due to necessary trip cancellation or postponement arising from Insured Events occurring within 30 days before departure. Includes coverage for loss of frequent flyer or similar travel points used to purchase an airline ticket.
    *   **Source:** [Page 4, Section 13 & Page 2 Highlights, Sompo Insurance_Elite document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The policy covers Trip Cancellation up to SGD 15,000 per person due to "Insured Events". The customer is concerned about cancellation due to a "family emergency". While serious illness or death of a close family member is typically considered an "Insured Event" in travel policies, the provided details don't explicitly list all covered events. Confirmation is needed from the full policy wording to ensure the specific type of family emergency anticipated by the customer falls under the definition of an "Insured Event".

## Customer Requirement: Travel Delays

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Travel Delay
    *   **Category:** Cash Benefits
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Per Insured Person (1st 6 hrs - Overseas or Singapore): SGD 100
        *   Per Insured Person (Overseas per subsequent 4 hrs): SGD 65

    *   **Limits:**
        *   Per Insured Person (1st 6 hrs): SGD 100
        *   Per Insured Person (per subsequent 4 hrs): SGD 65
        *   Maximum Limit: SGD 1,500
    *   **Details:** Pays a cash benefit if your flight is deviated from its scheduled route due to adverse weather conditions or the emergency medical treatment of a fellow passenger, resulting in delayed arrival at your destination.
    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Section 21, Sompo Insurance_Elite document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Certain
*   **Justification:** The policy directly addresses travel delays with cash benefits starting after a 6-hour delay, with subsequent payments for further delays up to a maximum limit. It also covers delays due to flight deviation. This aligns well with the customer's requirement for protection against extra costs due to travel delays.

    *   **Source:** [Page 4, Section 11, Sompo Insurance_Elite document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Baggage Delay
    *   **Category:** Cash Benefits
    *   **Limits:**

    *   **Details:** Pays a cash benefit for delay in arrival of your checked-in baggage for specified durations. Extended to cover delay if your baggage is wrongly picked up by another passenger whilst overseas.
    *   **Source:** [Page 4, Section 18, Sompo Insurance_Elite document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Certain
*   **Justification:** The policy provides coverage for both loss/damage to baggage (up to SGD 8,000 per person with sub-limits) and delay of baggage (cash benefit). This directly addresses the customer's requirement.

## Customer Requirement: Sports and Adventure Activities

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Amateur Sports Cover
    *   **Category:** Bonus Covers
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Coverage scope: Included
    *   **Details:** Covers participation in specific amateur sports including tandem air sports (skydiving, hang-gliding, paragliding), snow-skiing, hot-air ballooning, bungee jumping, indoor rock climbing, and trekking up to 3,500m above sea level for all mountains.
    *   **Source:** [Page 2, Highlights & Page 1, Sompo Insurance_Elite document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Certain
*   **Justification:** The policy explicitly includes "Amateur Sports Cover" which lists "snow-skiing" as a covered activity. This directly matches the customer's specific interest in skiing coverage. Medical expenses or personal accident claims arising from participation in covered sports would typically fall under the main medical/accident sections, subject to their respective limits and conditions.

## Customer Requirement: War or Political Unrest

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Full Terrorism Cover
    *   **Category:** Bonus Covers
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Aggregate limit for applicable Sections: SGD 500,000
    *   **Details:** Extends cover under specified sections (e.g., Personal Accident, Medical Expenses, Travel Delay) to include losses directly caused by an Act of Terrorism, subject to an overall aggregate limit.
    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Section 26, Sompo Insurance_Elite document]

*   **Coverage Name:** War Cover
    *   **Category:** Bonus Covers
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Coverage scope: Extension to Section 1
    *   **Details:** Extends the Personal Accident cover (Section 1) to apply if you sustain Accidental Death or Permanent Disablement as an innocent bystander due to war or civil war.
    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Section 27, Sompo Insurance_Elite document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The policy includes "Full Terrorism Cover" which extends several key benefits (like medical, accident, delay) to cover losses from terrorism, up to an aggregate limit. It also provides limited "War Cover" specifically for Personal Accident if the insured is an innocent bystander. However, the customer requirement is phrased as "War or Political Unrest". While terrorism is covered, the extent of coverage for broader "political unrest" (e.g., riots, civil commotion not classified as war or terrorism) or cancellation/disruption *due* to political unrest or war is not explicitly detailed in the provided JSON snippets for sections like Trip Cancellation or Trip Disruption. The War Cover is also limited to Personal Accident. Therefore, while some aspects are covered, the full scope requested under "political unrest" might not be fully met, especially concerning trip disruption or cancellation.

## Summary of Unmatched Requirements

All customer requirements listed in `insurance_coverage_type` had at least one potential policy coverage match identified, although certainty varies, particularly regarding pre-existing condition coverage under general medical expenses, specific reasons for trip cancellation, and the full scope of "political unrest" coverage.
