This report compares the customer's stated insurance requirements against the Sompo Vital travel insurance policy.

## Customer Requirement Summary

Travel insurance for a 2-week trip to Japan for two adults aged 26-40, covering medical expenses, trip cancellation, travel delays, lost luggage, sports activities, and political unrest.

## Detailed Customer Description

The customer is looking for travel insurance for a 2-week trip to Japan. They require cover for medical emergencies due to potential illness, including an existing condition (asthma) of one traveler. There are concerns about needing to cancel the trip due to a family emergency, and they seek protection against travel delays that could incur extra costs. The customer is also interested in coverage for lost or damaged luggage, and specifically for injuries during skiing, an adventurous activity they plan to try. Additionally, they want to ensure they are covered regarding political unrest or unforeseen events occurring in Japan during their stay. They have a budget preference of $200-$300 for this insurance.

*   **Coverage Name:** Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation (Including Mortal Remains) Back to Singapore
    *   **Category:** Personal Covers
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Per Insured Person up to 70 years: 600000
        *   Per Insured Person above 70 years: 100000
        *   Per Insured Person (Pre-existing Conditions): N.A.
        *   Per Family: No aggregate limit for family

    *   **Source:** [Page 3, Section 4, Sompo_Vital document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Overseas Hospitalisation Allowance
    *   **Category:** Personal Covers
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Per Insured Person: 200 (per day, up to 20 days)
    *   **Details:** Payable for each complete day the insured person is hospitalised overseas.
    *   **Source:** [Page 3, Section 5, Sompo_Vital document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The policy provides coverage for medical expenses overseas and upon return, including evacuation. However, the customer requires cover for a pre-existing condition (Asthma). The Emergency Medical Evacuation section explicitly states "Pre-existing medical conditions are not covered under the Vital plan for this benefit". This strongly suggests that medical expenses arising from Asthma may also be excluded under the main Medical Expenses sections for the Vital tier. Confirmation in the full policy wording regarding pre-existing condition exclusions for general medical expenses is required.

## Customer Requirement: Trip Cancellation

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Trip Cancellation or Postponement
    *   **Category:** Inconvenience / Liability Covers
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Per Insured Person: 5000

    *   **Details:** Covers loss of travel and accommodation expenses paid in advance due to trip cancellation, postponement, or replacement of traveller arising from Insured Events within 30 days before departure.
    *   **Source:** [Page 4, Section 13, Sompo_Vital document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Trip Curtailment
    *   **Category:** Inconvenience / Liability Covers
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Per Insured Person: 5000
        *   Per Family: 10000
    *   **Details:** Covers loss of the unused portion of prepaid travel costs and expenses after trip departure, arising from Insured Events resulting in your necessary and unavoidable return to Singapore.
    *   **Source:** [Page 4, Section 14, Sompo_Vital document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The policy includes Trip Cancellation coverage. However, the customer's specific concern is cancellation due to a "family emergency". Coverage depends on whether this reason falls under the policy's definition of "Insured Events". Typically, serious illness/injury/death of the insured or a close relative is covered, but the exact definition requires consulting the full policy wording, which is not provided in the JSON extract.

    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Section 24, Sompo_Vital document]

### Match Certainty

## Customer Requirement: Sports and Adventure Activities

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Amateur Sports Cover
    *   **Category:** General Highlights (Informational)
    *   **Limits:** []
    *   **Details:** The brochure highlights cover for amateur sports including tandem skydiving and trekking up to 3,500m. However, specific limits or applicability under the Vital tier are not detailed in the benefit tables (Pages 3-6). Coverage might be subject to Personal Accident or Medical Expense limits and conditions. Refer to policy wording for specifics.
    *   **Source:** [Page 1 & 2 Highlights, Sompo_Vital document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Personal Accident
    *   **Category:** Personal Covers
    *   **Limits:**
        *   70 years & below: 150000
        *   Over 70 years: 50000
        *   Child: 50000
        *   Per Family: No aggregate limit for family
    *   **Details:** Covers Accidental Death, Permanent Disablement and Third Degree Burns occurring during the trip.
    *   **Source:** [Page 3, Section 1, Sompo_Vital document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Medical Expenses Incurred Overseas
    *   **Category:** Personal Covers
    *   **Limits:** (See Medical Expenses section above)
    *   **Details:** Covers outpatient and hospitalisation medical expenses incurred overseas arising from accident or sickness...
    *   **Source:** [Page 3, Section 2, Sompo_Vital document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The policy highlights mention "Amateur Sports Cover", suggesting some level of coverage exists. Injuries sustained during such activities might fall under the general "Personal Accident" or "Medical Expenses" coverage, provided the activity is not excluded. However, the provided JSON for the Vital tier does *not* explicitly confirm coverage for skiing, nor does it detail specific conditions or exclusions related to sports under this tier. The "Amateur Sports Cover" is listed under "General Highlights" without specific limits for Vital, indicating the need to consult the full policy wording for confirmation and clarification on skiing coverage.

## Customer Requirement: War or Political Unrest

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** War Cover
    *   **Category:** Bonus Covers
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Coverage: Extension to Section 1
    *   **Details:** Extends the Personal Accident cover (Section 1) to include Accidental Death & Permanent Disablement if the insured is an innocent bystander during an act of war.
    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Section 27, Sompo_Vital document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The policy includes a specific "War Cover" bonus, but it is very limited: it only extends the Personal Accident benefit (death/disablement) and only applies if the insured is an innocent bystander during an act of war. It does *not* appear to cover trip cancellation, curtailment, delays, or medical expenses arising from war or, more broadly, political unrest, riots, or civil commotion, which are often standard exclusions unless explicitly covered. The customer's requirement for coverage related to "political unrest or unforeseen events" is likely not fully met by this limited War Cover bonus. Full policy wording is needed to check general exclusions related to political instability.
