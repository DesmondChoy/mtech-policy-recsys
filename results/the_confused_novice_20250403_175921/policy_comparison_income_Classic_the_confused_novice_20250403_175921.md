This report compares the customer's stated insurance requirements against the Income Classic travel insurance policy.

## Customer Requirement Summary

Travel insurance for a 2-week trip to Japan for two adults aged 26-40, covering medical expenses, trip cancellation, travel delays, lost luggage, sports activities, and political unrest.

## Detailed Customer Description

The customer is looking for travel insurance for a 2-week trip to Japan. They require cover for medical emergencies due to potential illness, including an existing condition (asthma) of one traveler.

They have a budget preference of $200-$300 for this insurance.

    *   **Limits:** (Not Applicable)

    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Income Insurance Limited - Classic document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The policy provides coverage for overseas medical expenses, follow-up treatment in Singapore, and emergency evacuation. However, the customer specifically mentioned a pre-existing condition (asthma). The "Medical expenses overseas" details and the explicit "Pre-existing Medical Conditions Exclusion" section state that the Classic plan *does not* cover claims arising from pre-existing conditions. Therefore, while general medical cover exists, it likely won't cover the specific asthma-related concern.

## Customer Requirement: Sports and Adventure Activities

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Adventurous Activities Cover
    *   **Category:** Other Benefits
    *   **Limits:**
        *   General: Covered under relevant sections (e.g., Medical, PA)
    *   **Details:** Covers participation in leisure adventurous activities like scuba diving (max 30m, with PADI cert or instructor), skiing, snowboarding, hiking/trekking (below 4000m, public access or organised/guided), bungee jumping, skydiving, hot air ballooning, etc., provided safety procedures are followed and licensed guides/instructors are used where available.

    *   **Source:** [Page 2, Benefit 3; Page 3; Page 10 Notes 2, 6, 7, Income Insurance Limited - Classic document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Certain
*   **Justification:** The policy includes an "Adventurous Activities Cover" section which explicitly lists skiing as a covered leisure activity. Injuries sustained during covered activities would fall under the relevant sections like "Medical expenses overseas" or "Personal accident", subject to their respective limits and conditions (and the pre-existing condition exclusion if the injury relates to asthma).

## Customer Requirement: War or Political Unrest

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Full terrorism cover
    *   **Category:** Other Benefits
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Adult 70 years old or over: 100000 (SGD)
        *   Adult under 70 years old: 150000 (SGD)
        *   Child: 75000 (SGD)
        *   Family total: 600000 (SGD)
    *   **Details:** Provides cover under Sections 1 to 25 (except exclusions like nuclear, chemical, biological terrorism) if losses are caused by an act of terrorism. The payout is subject to the lower of the original section limit or the terrorism sub-limit specified here.
    *   **Source:** [Page 9, Section 26, Income Insurance Limited - Classic document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The policy offers "Full terrorism cover," which addresses a specific type of political unrest. It extends coverage from other sections (like medical, cancellation) to losses caused by terrorism, up to specific sub-limits. However, "political unrest" is a broader term than "terrorism". The policy might not cover events like civil commotion, riots, or government instability unless they are specifically defined as terrorism under the policy or fall under another covered peril (e.g., cancellation due to government travel advisory changes, if specified). Therefore, while there is some relevant coverage, it may not fully encompass all scenarios the customer envisages under "political unrest".

## Summary of Unmatched Requirements

*   All customer requirements had at least one potential policy coverage match identified. However, the coverage for "Medical Expenses" related to the pre-existing condition (asthma) is explicitly excluded in this Classic plan, and the coverage for "War or Political Unrest" is limited specifically to "Terrorism" as defined by the policy.
