## Customer Requirement Summary

Travel insurance for a 2-week trip to Japan for two adults aged 26-40, covering medical expenses, trip cancellation, travel delays, lost luggage, sports activities, and political unrest.

## Detailed Customer Description

The customer is looking for travel insurance for a 2-week trip to Japan. They require cover for medical emergencies due to potential illness, including an existing condition (asthma) of one traveler.

They have a budget preference of $200-$300 for this insurance.

        *   Emergency medical evacuation & repatriation: Covered
    *   **Details:** OPTIONAL ADD-ON: Reimburses claims directly arising from a pre-existing medical condition (condition known, or treated/advised in last 12 months) for specified benefits. Medical/Evacuation covered up to specified limits. Standard medical exclusions apply.
    *   **Source:** [Page 9, Pages 22-26, FWD insurance_Business document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The policy provides extensive coverage for *unexpected* medical expenses overseas and upon return, including evacuation. However, the customer explicitly mentioned a pre-existing condition (asthma). Standard coverage likely excludes claims arising from this. The policy offers an **Optional Add-On** for "Pre-existing medical conditions" which would be **required** to cover asthma-related emergencies, up to specific limits (SGD 100,000 for overseas medical). Without this add-on, the match for the customer's specific need regarding asthma is not met. Coverage for injuries during skiing falls under general medical/accident cover, assuming skiing isn't an excluded hazardous activity (which is common but not explicitly stated as excluded here).

## Customer Requirement: Trip Cancellation

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Trip cancellation and loss of deposit
    *   **Category:** Protecting your travel plans
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Per Person: SGD 10000
        *   Overall limit for family plan: SGD 25000
    *   **Details:** Pays benefit if the entire trip is cancelled due to specified events within 30 days before departure. Covered events include serious injury/illness/death of insured/travel companion/family member making unfit to travel (confirmed by doctor), witness duty, serious home damage, serious public event, airline cancellation due to specific reasons, hijack >12 hours. Covers unused, non-refundable costs. Excludes claims if policy purchased <72 hours before departure.
    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Pages 10-11, FWD insurance_Business document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Pre-existing medical conditions (Optional Add-On)
    *   **Category:** Optional Covers (Separate Purchase Required unless stated otherwise)
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Trip cancellation and loss of deposit (50% co-payment): SGD 10000
    *   **Details:** OPTIONAL ADD-ON: Reimburses claims directly arising from a pre-existing medical condition for specified benefits, including Trip Cancellation (subject to 50% co-payment). Covers trip impact due to serious injury/illness/death from the condition affecting insured, travelling family member or travel companion (if they also bought the cover).
    *   **Source:** [Page 9, Pages 22-26, FWD insurance_Business document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Cancel for any reason (Optional Add-On)
    *   **Category:** Optional Covers (Separate Purchase Required unless stated otherwise)
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Trip cancellation for any reason: SGD 3000
        *   Overall limit for family plan (Cancellation): SGD 7500
    *   **Details:** OPTIONAL ADD-ON: Reimburses 50% of non-refundable travel costs (up to limit) if you cancel for any reason not covered by standard cancellation. Must be purchased within 7 days of initial trip deposit.
    *   **Source:** [Page 9, Page 27, FWD insurance_Business document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Certain (with considerations)
*   **Justification:** The policy directly covers "Trip cancellation" for several reasons, including a family emergency (serious illness/death of a family member). This aligns well with the customer's concern. However, if the cancellation is due to the pre-existing asthma condition (of the traveler or a family member), the **Optional Add-On** for "Pre-existing medical conditions" would be required (with a 50% co-payment). For reasons outside the specified list, the **Optional Add-On** "Cancel for any reason" offers partial reimbursement but must be bought early. Standard cancellation coverage for typical family emergencies is certain.

## Customer Requirement: Travel Delays

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Travel delay
    *   **Category:** Protecting your travel plans
    *   **Limits:**
        *   While overseas: SGD 500 (SGD 100 for every six hours delay)
        *   In Singapore only: SGD 100 (SGD 100 for the first six hours delay)
    *   **Details:** Pays benefit if scheduled public transport is delayed or overbooked for 6+ continuous hours. Requires written proof from provider. Must have checked in on time. Excludes delays caused by the insured party.
    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Pages 12-13, FWD insurance_Business document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Certain
*   **Justification:** The policy has a specific "Travel delay" benefit that provides cash compensation for delays of 6 hours or more on scheduled public transport, matching the customer's requirement.

Payment based on purchase price less depreciation (formula provided) or repair cost. Specific items (phone, laptop, jewellery) must be carried, not checked-in. Requires care, police report within 24hrs for theft. Excludes certain items, wear & tear, unexplained loss.
    *   **Source:** [Page 6, Pages 14-15, FWD insurance_Business document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Baggage delay
    *   **Category:** Protecting your stuff
    *   **Limits:**
        *   While overseas: SGD 600 (SGD 150 for every six hours of delay)

    *   **Source:** [Page 6, Page 14, FWD insurance_Business document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Certain

## Customer Requirement: Sports and Adventure Activities

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Medical expenses incurred overseas (Related - for injuries)
    *   **Category:** Protecting you and your health
    *   **Limits:** (See Medical Expenses section above)
    *   **Details:** Covers medically necessary treatment for unexpected injuries sustained during the trip, which would include injuries from recreational skiing unless specifically excluded.
    *   **Source:** [Page 7, Page 19, FWD insurance_Business document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Personal accident (Related - for severe injuries/disability)
    *   **Category:** Protecting you and your health
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Adult below 70 years of age: SGD 300000
        *   Adult 70 years old or older: SGD 60000
        *   Child covered under a family plan: SGD 90000
        *   Overall limit for family plan: SGD 750000
    *   **Details:** Pays lump sum for accidental death or specified permanent disabilities resulting from an accident during the trip.
    *   **Source:** [Page 7, Page 18, FWD insurance_Business document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Sports equipment protector (Optional Add-On - for equipment)
    *   **Category:** Optional Covers (Separate Purchase Required unless stated otherwise)
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Overall limit for damage/theft: SGD 2000
        *   Rental cost limit: SGD 100 per day
    *   **Details:** OPTIONAL ADD-ON: Covers theft, damage, loss of owned sports equipment (including skis/snowboards). Covers rental costs for replacement. Depreciation applies. Excludes damage during practice or play.
    *   **Source:** [Page 9, Pages 26-27, FWD insurance_Business document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The requirement is broad. The policy likely covers *injuries* sustained during recreational skiing under the standard "Medical expenses incurred overseas" and "Personal accident" benefits, provided skiing is not listed as an excluded hazardous activity (policy details provided do not specify exclusions). However, coverage for damage or loss of the *sports equipment* itself (e.g., skis) is **only available** via the **Optional Add-On** "Sports equipment protector". Therefore, the standard policy only partially meets the requirement (covering potential injury), and full coverage including equipment requires an extra purchase.

## Customer Requirement: War or Political Unrest

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Terrorism cover
    *   **Category:** Protecting your travel plans
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Overall: Covered
    *   **Details:** The policy provides cover for claims resulting directly from an act of terrorism during the trip, subject to the limits and conditions specified for each relevant benefit section (e.g., medical, cancellation). Defines 'act of terrorism'.
    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Page 14, FWD insurance_Business document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Trip cancellation and loss of deposit (Related - for 'serious public event')
    *   **Category:** Protecting your travel plans
    *   **Limits:** (See Trip Cancellation section above)
    *   **Details:** Includes "serious public event preventing travel" as a covered reason for cancellation. This *might* cover some scenarios related to political unrest, but likely excludes declared/undeclared war or widespread civil commotion based on typical general exclusions (not fully detailed in snippet).
    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Pages 10-11, FWD insurance_Business document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Trip disruption (Related - for 'serious public event')
    *   **Category:** Protecting your travel plans
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Per Person: SGD 2000
    *   **Details:** Covers itinerary changes forced by a "serious public event occurring in Singapore or a travel destination". Covers additional transport/accommodation or unused prepaid costs. Exclusions apply.
    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Page 13, FWD insurance_Business document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain/Partial
*   **Justification:** The policy explicitly includes "Terrorism cover". However, "Political unrest" is broader. While cancellation/disruption due to a "serious public event" is covered, the exact definition and whether it encompasses all forms of political unrest is unclear. General exclusions, typically found in full policy wordings, often exclude claims arising from war (declared or undeclared), civil war, insurrection, or widespread civil commotion. Therefore, while terrorism is covered, comprehensive cover for all types of political unrest is uncertain and likely limited.

## Summary of Unmatched Requirements

*   All customer requirements had at least one potential policy coverage match identified, although some matches are partial or require optional add-ons for full alignment with the customer's specific needs (notably Pre-existing Conditions and Sports Equipment).

**Note:** This comparison does not assess the policy premium against the customer's budget range of $200-$300, as premium information was not provided. The customer must verify the cost, including any necessary optional add-ons (Pre-existing Conditions, potentially Sports Equipment Protector), falls within their budget. They should also carefully review the full policy wording for specific exclusions, especially regarding hazardous activities (like skiing) and the precise definition of "serious public event" related to political unrest cover.
