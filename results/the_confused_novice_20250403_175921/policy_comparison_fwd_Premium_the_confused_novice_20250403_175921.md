*   **Coverage Name:** Pre-existing medical conditions - Medical expenses incurred overseas (Optional Add-on)
    *   **Category:** Optional Covers (Premium Tier Limits)
    *   **Limits:**

*   **Coverage Name:** Pre-existing medical conditions - Emergency medical evacuation & repatriation (Optional Add-on)
    *   **Category:** Optional Covers (Premium Tier Limits)
    *   **Limits:**

    *   **Details:** Optional Cover. Covers costs arranged by Emergency Assistance for evacuation/repatriation if medically necessary due to a life-threatening pre-existing condition occurring overseas. Excludes terminal illness diagnosis (<12mths).
    *   **Source:** [Page 9, Page 24, Page 26, FWD insurance - Premium document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The policy provides comprehensive coverage for general medical expenses overseas and repatriation (certain match for general illness/injury). However, the customer requires cover for a pre-existing condition (asthma). The standard medical expense coverages likely exclude claims arising from pre-existing conditions (this is standard practice and implied by the existence of the optional add-on). Coverage for asthma-related medical expenses is only available if the **Optional Cover for Pre-existing medical conditions** is purchased, which provides a limit of SGD 50,000 for overseas medical expenses and SGD 50,000 for evacuation/repatriation related to the pre-existing condition. Therefore, the standard policy does *not* fully meet this requirement, but it *can* be met with the add-on.

## Customer Requirement: Trip Cancellation

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Trip cancellation and loss of deposit
    *   **Category:** Protecting your travel plans
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Per Person: 7500 (SGD)
        *   Overall limit for family plan: 18750 (SGD)
    *   **Details:** Pays for irrecoverable travel costs if the entire trip is cancelled within 30 days before departure due to specified events (e.g., serious injury/illness/death of insured/companion/family member, witness duty, home damage, serious public event, hijack). Covers unused accommodation, transport, tours etc., and cancellation fees. Requires asking for refunds first. Excludes claims if policy bought less than 72 hours before departure (unless due to accidental death). If this benefit is paid for a single trip policy, the policy ends.
    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Page 10-11, FWD insurance - Premium document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Pre-existing medical conditions - Trip cancellation and loss of deposit (Optional Add-on)
    *   **Category:** Optional Covers (Premium Tier Limits)
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Per Person (50% co-payment): 7500 (SGD)
    *   **Details:** Optional Cover. Reimburses 50% of irrecoverable travel costs if trip cancelled within 30 days before departure due to specified events (serious pre-existing injury/illness making unfit to travel, death) affecting insured, travelling family member, or travel companion (who must also have this cover). Excludes terminal illness diagnosis (<12mths).
    *   **Source:** [Page 9, Page 22, Page 24, Page 25, Page 26, FWD insurance - Premium document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Cancel for any reason - Trip cancellation (Optional Add-on)
    *   **Category:** Optional Covers (Premium Tier Limits)
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Per Person (50% reimbursement): 1000 (SGD)
        *   Overall limit for family plan (50% reimbursement): 2500 (SGD)
    *   **Details:** Optional Cover. Reimburses 50% of irrecoverable travel costs if trip cancelled for any reason not covered elsewhere. Must purchase cover within 7 days of initial trip deposit. Excludes refunded amounts. Policy ends if benefit paid.
    *   **Source:** [Page 9, Page 27, Page 28, FWD insurance - Premium document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The standard "Trip cancellation and loss of deposit" covers cancellation due to specified events, including a family emergency (serious illness/injury/death of a family member), which matches one aspect of the customer's concern. However, it would *not* cover cancellation due to the traveler's own pre-existing asthma condition flaring up unless the **Optional Cover for Pre-existing medical conditions** is purchased (which has a 50% co-payment). For broader cancellation reasons beyond specified events or pre-existing conditions, the **Optional Cancel for any reason** cover could apply (also 50% reimbursement, lower limit, must be bought within 7 days of deposit). The standard policy partially meets the requirement, but full coverage including the pre-existing condition requires an add-on.

## Customer Requirement: Travel Delays

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Travel delay
    *   **Category:** Protecting your travel plans
    *   **Limits:**

    *   **Limits:**

    *   **Limits:**
        *   Per Person Max: 500 (SGD) (S$100 for every six hours diverted while overseas)
    *   **Details:** Pays S$100 for every 6 continuous hours an aircraft you are travelling on is diverted to another destination before reaching your scheduled destination.
    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Page 12, Page 13, FWD insurance - Premium document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Certain
*   **Justification:** The policy includes specific coverage for "Travel delay" providing cash benefits for delays over 6 hours. Related coverages like "Missed connections" and "Trip diversion" also address potential costs/inconvenience arising from delays. This directly matches the customer requirement.

    *   **Source:** [Page 6, Page 14, FWD insurance - Premium document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Certain
*   **Justification:** The policy explicitly covers "Theft of or damage to baggage or personal belongings" up to specified limits and sub-limits, directly addressing the customer's requirement for lost or damaged luggage. It also includes cover for baggage delay.

## Customer Requirement: Sports and Adventure Activities

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Medical expenses incurred overseas
    *   **Category:** Protecting you and your health
    *   **Limits:** (See limits under "Medical Expenses" requirement)
    *   **Details:** (See details under "Medical Expenses" requirement). The details do not explicitly exclude recreational skiing, but coverage might be subject to General Exclusions not listed in the provided snippet (e.g., professional sports, hazardous activities definition).
    *   **Source:** [Page 7, Page 19, FWD insurance - Premium document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Personal accident
    *   **Category:** Protecting you and your health
    *   **Limits:**

        *   Overall limit for family plan: 500000 (SGD)

    *   **Source:** [Page 7, Page 18, FWD insurance - Premium document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Sports equipment protector (Optional Add-on)
    *   **Category:** Optional Covers (Premium Tier Limits)
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Per Person Max: 2000 (SGD)

    *   **Source:** [Page 9, Page 28-29, FWD insurance - Premium document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The customer requires cover specifically for *injuries* during skiing. The standard "Medical expenses incurred overseas" and "Personal accident" coverages *should* apply to injuries sustained during recreational skiing, as it's not explicitly excluded in the provided benefit details. However, travel insurance policies often have General Exclusions related to hazardous activities or sports, which are not fully detailed here. Confirmation with FWD regarding recreational skiing coverage under the standard benefits is recommended. The policy offers an **Optional Sports equipment protector**, but this covers *damage or loss of equipment*, not personal injury sustained while using it (it specifically excludes damage during use).

## Customer Requirement: War or Political Unrest

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Terrorism cover
    *   **Category:** Protecting your travel plans
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Coverage Status: Covered
    *   **Details:** The policy provides cover for claims resulting directly from an act of terrorism during the trip, subject to the limits and conditions specified for each applicable benefit section. An act of terrorism involves force or violence for political, religious, or ideological aims to influence government or put the public in fear.
    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Page 14, FWD insurance - Premium document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Trip cancellation and loss of deposit
    *   **Category:** Protecting your travel plans
    *   **Limits:** (See limits under "Trip Cancellation" requirement)
    *   **Details:** Covers trip cancellation due to specified events, including a "serious public event". This *might* cover situations arising from political unrest, depending on FWD's definition of "serious public event".
    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Page 10-11, FWD insurance - Premium document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Trip cut short
    *   **Category:** Protecting your travel plans
    *   **Limits:** (See limits under "Trip Cancellation" requirement - *Note: Trip Cut Short limits apply*)
        * Per Person: 5000 (SGD)
        * Overall limit for family plan: 12500 (SGD)
    *   **Details:** Covers early return due to specified events overseas, including a "serious public event". This *might* cover situations arising from political unrest.
    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Page 10-11, FWD insurance - Premium document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Trip disruption
    *   **Category:** Protecting your travel plans
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Per Person: 1000 (SGD)

    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Page 13, FWD insurance - Premium document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The policy explicitly includes "Terrorism cover", which addresses part of the customer's concern. Several other benefits (Trip Cancellation, Trip Cut Short, Trip Disruption) mention coverage related to a "serious public event". Whether this term encompasses the customer's broader concern of "political unrest" depends on FWD's specific definition and the nature of the event. Standard exclusions often apply to declared or undeclared war. While terrorism is covered, the extent of coverage for other forms of political unrest or unforeseen civil commotion under "serious public event" is not fully clear from the provided details.

---

## Summary of Unmatched Requirements

All customer requirements had at least one potential policy coverage match identified. However, key areas require attention:
*   **Medical Expenses (Pre-existing Condition):** Standard cover is insufficient; requires the purchase of the **Optional Cover for Pre-existing medical conditions**.
*   **Trip Cancellation (Pre-existing Condition):** Standard cover is insufficient if cancellation is due to the pre-existing condition; requires the purchase of the **Optional Cover for Pre-existing medical conditions** (50% co-pay).
*   **Sports and Adventure Activities (Skiing Injury):** Coverage under standard medical/accident benefits is likely but should be confirmed with the insurer, as specific exclusions for hazardous activities might apply.
*   **War or Political Unrest:** Terrorism is explicitly covered. Coverage for broader political unrest depends on whether events qualify under the policy's definition of a "serious public event" and are not excluded by general war/unrest exclusions.
