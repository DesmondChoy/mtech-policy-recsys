## Customer Requirement Summary

Travel insurance for a 2-week trip to Japan for two adults aged 26-40, covering medical expenses, trip cancellation, travel delays, lost luggage, sports activities, and political unrest.

## Detailed Customer Description

The customer is looking for travel insurance for a 2-week trip to Japan. They require cover for medical emergencies due to potential illness, including an existing condition (asthma) of one traveler.

The customer is also interested in coverage for lost or damaged luggage, and specifically for injuries during skiing, an adventurous activity they plan to try. Additionally, they want to ensure they are covered regarding political unrest or unforeseen events occurring in Japan during their stay. They have a budget preference of $200-$300 for this insurance.

    *   **Category:** Personal Accident and Medical Expenses Benefits

    *   **Source:** [Page 8, Section 17, Income Insurance - Deluxe document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The policy provides substantial coverage for medical expenses incurred overseas and follow-up treatment in Singapore, including emergency evacuation. However, the policy details explicitly state that pre-existing conditions are *not* covered under "Medical expenses overseas" (Section 14) or "Medical expenses in Singapore" (Section 15). Since the customer specifically mentioned requiring cover for potential issues related to asthma (a pre-existing condition), this policy tier does **not** meet that specific requirement. General medical needs due to *new* illnesses or accidents during the trip are covered.

## Customer Requirement: Trip Cancellation

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Cancelling your trip
    *   **Category:** Travel Inconvenience Benefits
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Per insured person: 10000 SGD
        *   Family total: 30000 SGD
    *   **Details:** Covers irrecoverable overseas transport and accommodation expenses paid in advance if the trip is cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances like COVID-19 (must result in serious sickness). Cancellation event must occur after policy purchase and within 30 days before departure (unless accidental in nature). Policy must be bought three days (or earlier) before leaving Singapore unless the event is only accidental in nature. Eligibility for COVID-19 cover requires fulfilling relevant conditions (vaccination/tests if required) and the event meeting section requirements.
    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Section 1; Page 3; Page 10 Note 5; Page 11 Note 10, Income Insurance - Deluxe document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Certain
*   **Justification:** The policy includes a specific "Cancelling your trip" benefit covering irrecoverable costs due to unforeseen circumstances. While "family emergency" isn't explicitly listed in the provided details, such events typically fall under 'unforeseen circumstances' in standard travel insurance policies (subject to specific policy wording definitions, which should be verified). The limits are substantial. The requirement for the event to occur within 30 days before departure (unless accidental) is a key condition.

## Customer Requirement: Travel Delays

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

    *   **Category:** Travel Inconvenience Benefits

        *   Family total: 3000 SGD

    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Section 5; Page 2 Key Benefit 4; Page 10 Note 3, Income Insurance - Deluxe document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Certain
*   **Justification:** The policy has a dedicated "Travel delay" coverage that provides cash benefits for delays exceeding six hours, addressing the customer's requirement for protection against extra costs due to delays. The benefit structure (per 6 hours) and limits are clearly defined.

## Customer Requirement: Lost or Damaged Luggage

    *   **Source:** [Page 6, Section 9, Income Insurance - Deluxe document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Certain
*   **Justification:** The policy directly addresses "Lost or Damaged Luggage" through the "Loss or damage of baggage and personal belongings" coverage, with specified limits per item and overall. It also includes coverage for "Baggage delay," which is often related to luggage issues.

## Customer Requirement: Sports and Adventure Activities

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

        *   N/A: Covered subject to policy terms and section limits

*   **Coverage Name:** Personal accident
    *   **Category:** Personal Accident and Medical Expenses Benefits

    *   **Details:** Provides lump sum payment for accidental death or injury resulting in permanent disability, loss of limb, sight, speech, or hearing during the trip, according to the specified Scale of Compensation (e.g., 100% for death/total disability, 50% for one limb/eye). Total payout from scale items a-h cannot exceed the benefit limit. Injuries sustained during covered adventurous activities would fall under this benefit.
    *   **Source:** [Page 7, Section 13, Income Insurance - Deluxe document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Medical expenses overseas
    *   **Category:** Personal Accident and Medical Expenses Benefits
    *   **Limits:** (Relevant limits for adults aged 26-40)
        *   Adult under 70 years old: 500000 SGD

    *   **Source:** [Page 7, Section 14; Page 3; Page 5, Income Insurance - Deluxe document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Certain
*   **Justification:** The policy explicitly includes an "Adventurous Activities Cover" which lists "skiing" as a covered activity, provided standard safety precautions are met. Injuries sustained during such activities would potentially trigger benefits under "Personal accident" and "Medical expenses overseas," directly addressing the customer's need for coverage related to skiing injuries.

## Customer Requirement: War or Political Unrest

### Policy Coverage Match(es)

*   **Coverage Name:** Full terrorism cover (for sections 1 to 25)
    *   **Category:** Other Benefits
    *   **Limits:** (Relevant limits for adults aged 26-40)
        *   Adult under 70 years old: 200000 SGD
        *   Child: 100000 SGD
        *   Family total: 800000 SGD
    *   **Details:** Provides cover under sections 1 to 25 if the claim arises directly from an act of terrorism (excluding nuclear, chemical, biological terrorism). The limits shown are the maximum aggregate payable for all terrorism-related claims per person/family across all applicable sections (1-25).
    *   **Source:** [Page 9, Section 26, Income Insurance - Deluxe document]

*   **Coverage Name:** Trip disruption
    *   **Category:** Travel Inconvenience Benefits
    *   **Limits:**
        *   Per insured person - Overall section limit: 2000 SGD
        *   Per insured person - Limit for accommodation expenses per room per night: 400 SGD
        *   Family total: 6000 SGD
    *   **Details:** Covers reasonable additional accommodation and transport expenses incurred overseas due to serious injury/sickness, natural disaster, strike, riot, or civil commotion disrupting the planned trip. No specific additional details found for this tier beyond the benefit description.
    *   **Source:** [Page 5, Section 4, Income Insurance - Deluxe document]

### Match Certainty

*   **Certainty:** Uncertain
*   **Justification:** The policy offers "Full terrorism cover" which applies relevant benefits (like medical, cancellation, disruption) if the cause is terrorism. Additionally, "Trip disruption" covers extra expenses due to "riot" or "civil commotion". These cover aspects of political unrest. However, the term "political unrest" is broad and may encompass situations not explicitly covered (e.g., declared war, coups, widespread civil disorder not classified as riot/terrorism). Standard war exclusions might apply unless overridden by the terrorism cover. Therefore, while some key aspects related to political instability (terrorism, riot, civil commotion) are addressed, it's uncertain if *all* potential scenarios under the umbrella of "political unrest" are covered.

## Summary of Unmatched Requirements

*   The customer's requirement for **Medical Expenses** coverage to include treatment related to a **pre-existing condition (asthma)** is **not met** by this policy tier, as pre-existing conditions are explicitly excluded from the relevant medical expense coverages. All other listed requirements have at least one relevant policy coverage match identified, though the completeness of the "War or Political Unrest" coverage might depend on the specific event.
