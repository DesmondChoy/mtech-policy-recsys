**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, and Elite tiers against the customer's requirements for a trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation and does not appear to cover amateur sports like hiking, failing two key requirements.
*   **Deluxe:** Offers basic coverage for hiking (trekking up to 3,500m) and provides a sub-limit ($100k for under 70s) for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions. However, its overall medical ($300k) and cancellation ($6k) limits are lower.
*   **GO Japan!:** Similar to Deluxe in many limits (e.g., $6k Cancellation, $100k pre-existing evacuation limit), but offers a higher overseas medical limit ($500k) and the convenience of cashless medical services in Japan. It covers hiking.
*   **Elite:** Provides the highest coverage limits across all key areas: Medical ($1M overseas), Cancellation ($15k), Luggage ($8k), Travel Delay ($2k), and Emergency Medical Evacuation for pre-existing conditions ($150k for under 70s). It also covers hiking (trekking up to 3,500m).

The customer has specific concerns about pre-existing conditions (high blood pressure), hiking, luggage, travel delay, and cancellation. While **no SOMPO tier explicitly covers the requested 'Pet accommodation coverage'**, the Elite tier offers the most comprehensive protection for the other major requirements. The significantly higher limits for medical expenses, emergency evacuation (including the pre-existing condition sub-limit), and trip cancellation provide greater peace of mind, addressing the customer's expressed concerns about potential high costs and unforeseen events. Although GO Japan! offers cashless service in Japan, the superior financial protection offered by Elite makes it the better overall choice, especially considering the pre-existing condition.

Therefore, the Elite tier is recommended as it provides the highest limits and covers hiking and pre-existing conditions (for evacuation), best addressing the majority of the customer's specific concerns, despite the universal lack of pet accommodation coverage among the available SOMPO tiers.
