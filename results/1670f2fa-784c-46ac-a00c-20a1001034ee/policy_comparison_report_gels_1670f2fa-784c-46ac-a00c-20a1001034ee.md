**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers against the customer's requirements:

*   **Basic Tier:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions (a key requirement for high blood pressure), does not cover adventurous leisure activities (like hiking), and lacks pet care coverage for accommodation due to delays.
*   **Gold Tier:** This tier addresses several shortcomings of the Basic plan. It offers an *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions (including high blood pressure), covers adventurous leisure activities (hiking), and includes pet care coverage. It provides moderate limits for medical ($500k), cancellation ($10k), luggage ($5k), and pet care ($500).
*   **Platinum Tier:** This tier also offers the crucial *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions, covers adventurous leisure activities (hiking), and includes pet care coverage. However, it provides significantly higher coverage limits across the board compared to Gold: Medical ($1M), Cancellation ($15k), Luggage ($8k), and Pet Care ($800). Furthermore, the pre-existing condition add-on itself has higher sub-limits under Platinum ($200k/$150k medical vs $150k/$100k in Gold). Travel delay benefits also trigger sooner (every 4 hours vs 6 hours in Gold/Basic).

Given the customer's specific concern about the pre-existing condition (high blood pressure), the higher medical limits (both general and within the optional add-on) provided by the Platinum tier offer a superior safety net. While both Gold and Platinum require the purchase of an add-on for this condition, Platinum provides the most comprehensive coverage levels for all stated requirements (Medical, Pre-existing condition option, Hiking, Luggage, Delay, Pet Care, Cancellation). Therefore, despite likely being the most expensive, the Platinum tier is recommended as the single most suitable option from GELS, offering the highest protection aligned with the customer's needs. The No Mix-and-Match rule necessitates choosing a single tier, and Platinum best fulfills the combination of requirements.
