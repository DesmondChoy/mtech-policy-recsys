**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing FWD's Premium, Business, and First tiers for this customer: All tiers offer base coverage for medical needs, cancellation, luggage, and travel delay, and allow optional add-ons for pre-existing conditions and pet care, which are crucial for this customer. However, they differ significantly in coverage limits.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Overseas Medical, $7.5k Cancellation, $3k Luggage). While the necessary add-ons are available, the pre-existing condition medical limit is only $50k (with 50% co-pay for some benefits), which might be insufficient for travel to Japan given the customer's high blood pressure concern.
*   **Business:** Provides a substantial increase in limits (e.g., $500k Overseas Medical, $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage). Crucially, the pre-existing condition add-on offers higher limits ($100k Medical, $100k Evacuation, $10k Cancellation with 50% co-pay), offering better protection for the customer's specific health concern. It also includes car rental excess cover, unlike Premium.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Overseas Medical, $15k Cancellation, $7.5k Luggage) including for the pre-existing condition add-on ($150k Medical, $150k Evacuation). While providing the most comprehensive cover, it is also the most expensive tier.

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier that best covers all requirements. The customer requires specific coverage for a pre-existing condition (high blood pressure) and pet accommodation due to delays, both necessitating add-ons. While all tiers offer these add-ons, the Business tier provides a significantly better balance between robust coverage levels (especially the enhanced limits for pre-existing conditions compared to Premium) and likely cost compared to the First tier. The $100k medical limit for pre-existing conditions under the Business add-on offers a reasonable level of security for travel to a destination like Japan.

Therefore, the **Business** tier is recommended as it provides a strong, balanced level of coverage across all the customer's key requirements, including significantly higher limits for the critical pre-existing condition coverage compared to the Premium tier, without potentially reaching the higher cost of the First tier.
