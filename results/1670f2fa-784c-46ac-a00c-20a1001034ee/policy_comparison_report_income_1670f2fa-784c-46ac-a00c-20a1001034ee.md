**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All tiers provide core coverage for Medical Expenses (excluding pre-existing conditions), Trip Cancellation, Luggage Loss/Damage, Travel Delay, and Hiking (under specific conditions). However, they differ significantly in coverage limits.

*   **Classic:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $5k Cancellation, $250k Medical Overseas, $3k Luggage).
*   **Deluxe:** Provides mid-range limits (e.g., $10k Cancellation, $500k Medical Overseas, $5k Luggage) and introduces Unlimited Medical Evacuation (for under 70s).
*   **Preferred:** Offers the highest limits across all key areas (e.g., $15k Cancellation, $1M Medical Overseas, $8k Luggage) and retains Unlimited Medical Evacuation (for under 70s).

Crucially, **none** of the standard tiers (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred) cover pre-existing medical conditions like high blood pressure, as explicitly stated in the policy details ("Standard plans do not cover pre-existing medical conditions."). Furthermore, **none** of the tiers specifically list coverage for pet accommodation costs due to travel delays. These are significant gaps relative to the customer's requirements.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. Despite the unmet requirements, the **Preferred** tier is recommended because it provides the most comprehensive coverage and highest limits for the requirements that *are* covered, particularly Trip Cancellation (addressing the concern about losing significant pre-paid costs) and Luggage protection. While it doesn't solve the pre-existing condition or pet accommodation issues, it offers the strongest protection for the other stated concerns like general medical needs, cancellation, luggage, travel delay, and hiking. The customer must be made aware that their pre-existing condition (high blood pressure) and pet accommodation costs are not covered under this standard plan.
