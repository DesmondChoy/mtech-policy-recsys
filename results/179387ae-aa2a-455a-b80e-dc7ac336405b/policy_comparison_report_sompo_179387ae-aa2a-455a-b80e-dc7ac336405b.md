**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) for the customer's trip to Japan:
*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it lacks explicit coverage for amateur sports like hiking, a stated requirement. Its coverage limits are also the lowest across the board.
*   **Deluxe:** Covers hiking and core requirements (Medical, Luggage, Delay, Cancellation). However, its Medical Overseas limit ($300k) is lower than GO Japan!.
*   **GO Japan!:** Specifically designed for travel to Japan, this tier covers hiking and all core requirements. It offers a higher Medical Overseas limit ($500k) than Deluxe and includes a valuable cashless medical service network within Japan (740 clinics/hospitals via EAJ). Trip Cancellation ($6k) and Luggage ($5k) limits are the same as Deluxe.
*   **Elite:** Provides the highest limits overall (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation). It covers hiking. However, it lacks the Japan-specific cashless medical network offered by the GO Japan! tier and is likely the most expensive option.

The customer requires solid coverage for Medical, Luggage, Delay, Cancellation, and specifically Hiking for a 2-week trip to Japan. They also need clarification on cancellation due to a family event (sister's wedding). While all tiers except Vital cover the core needs and hiking, GO Japan! stands out as the most suitable. It offers robust medical coverage ($500k) enhanced by a Japan-specific cashless network, which directly addresses the destination and potential medical concerns. It explicitly covers hiking up to 3,500m. While Elite offers higher limits, GO Japan! provides strong, well-rounded coverage tailored to the destination, likely offering better value than Elite given the requirements didn't specify needing maximum possible limits. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose one package; GO Japan! provides the best combination of relevant coverage and destination-specific benefits.

Therefore, the GO Japan! tier is recommended due to its specific design for Japan travel, including the cashless medical network, explicit hiking coverage, and strong limits for core requirements, representing a balanced and highly relevant option compared to the lower-limit Deluxe or the higher-limit (but less Japan-specific) Elite. The clarification regarding trip cancellation for a wedding is a policy interpretation point applicable across tiers (likely not covered), but GO Japan! best meets the other stated needs.

    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person', 'limit': 6000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 10000, 'basis': None}]

Includes coverage for loss of frequent flyer or similar travel points used to purchase an airline ticket.', 'source_location': 'Page 4, Section 13 & Page 2, Trip Cancellation or Postponement'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: The policy covers trip cancellation for standard "Insured Events" (typically unforeseen circumstances like serious illness/death of insured/close family, natural disaster, etc.) up to $6,000 per person. However, cancellation due to a known potential conflict like a sister's wedding, even if the date is uncertain, is highly unlikely to be considered an "Insured Event" and would typically be excluded as a change of plans or disinclination to travel. The customer should assume this specific reason is not covered.

### Requirement: Hiking

*   **Policy Coverage:** Personal Accident
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person - 70 years & below', 'limit': 250000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - Over 70 years', 'limit': 50000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Child', 'limit': 100000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 'No aggregate limit', 'basis': None}]

*   **Policy Coverage:** Medical Expenses Incurred Overseas
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person - 70 years & below', 'limit': 500000, 'basis': None}, ...] (See Medical Coverage section above for full limits)
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [... {'detail_snippet': 'Coverage includes medical expenses arising from amateur sports like tandem skydiving, hang-gliding, paragliding, snow-skiing, hot-air ballooning, bungee jumping, indoor rock climbing and trekking up to 3,500m above sea level for all mountains.', 'source_location': 'Page 2, Amateur Sports Cover'}] (See Medical Coverage section above for full details)
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met

### Requirement: Clarification needed on whether trip cancellation is covered due to a family event like sister's wedding.

*   **Policy Coverage:** Trip Cancellation or Postponement
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person', 'limit': 6000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 10000, 'basis': None}]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Covers non-refundable travel expenses if trip is cancelled or postponed due to Insured Events occurring within 30 days before departure. Includes coverage for loss of frequent flyer or similar travel points used to purchase an airline ticket.', 'source_location': 'Page 4, Section 13 & Page 2, Trip Cancellation or Postponement'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Not Met: Standard travel insurance policies define specific "Insured Events" that trigger trip cancellation coverage (e.g., unforeseen death/serious illness of insured/close relative, strike, natural disaster impacting destination). Cancelling a trip due to a scheduling conflict with a planned family event like a wedding, even if the date was initially uncertain, typically falls under general exclusions related to change of mind, conflicting commitments, or disinclination to travel. This specific reason is highly unlikely to be covered.
