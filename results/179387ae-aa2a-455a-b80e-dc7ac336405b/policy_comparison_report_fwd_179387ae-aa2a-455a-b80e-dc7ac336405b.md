**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for this customer traveling to Japan: All tiers cover the core requirements of Medical, Lost/Damaged Luggage, Travel Delay, standard Trip Cancellation, and leisure Hiking. However, they differ significantly in coverage limits and how they address the specific concern about cancelling for a sister's wedding.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Medical, $7.5k Cancellation, $3k Baggage) and the lowest potential reimbursement ($1k limit at 50%) via the optional 'Cancel for any reason' (CFAR) add-on for the wedding scenario.
*   **Business:** Provides mid-range limits (e.g., $500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $5k Baggage) and a moderate CFAR reimbursement limit ($3k at 50%). It includes Car Rental Excess cover.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $7.5k Baggage) and the highest CFAR reimbursement limit ($6k at 50%). It also includes Car Rental Excess cover.

The customer emphasized needing "solid Medical Coverage" for Japan (an expensive destination) and required specific clarification on cancellation for a significant family event (sister's wedding). Standard trip cancellation across all tiers does *not* cover cancellation for such events. The optional CFAR add-on is the only way FWD addresses this, albeit partially (50% reimbursement up to a limit, and must be bought within 7 days of the initial trip deposit).

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must choose one entire tier), the customer's flexibility on budget ("around $400 or maybe a bit more"), and their priority on getting the *right cover* (especially for medical and the specific cancellation query), the **First** tier is recommended. Although it is the most expensive, its significantly higher medical limits ($1M) provide strong reassurance for Japan, and its higher CFAR limit ($6k) offers the best available partial coverage for the specific wedding cancellation concern compared to the Business ($3k) and Premium ($1k) tiers.
