**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) for the customer's trip to Australia:
*   **GO Japan!** is unsuitable as it is specifically designed for travel to Japan.
*   **Vital** is unsuitable because it explicitly excludes coverage for the required activities: Bungee Jumping and Hot Air Ballooning (Amateur Sports Cover N.A.). It also offers the lowest coverage limits overall.
*   **Deluxe** covers Bungee Jumping and Hot Air Ballooning under its Amateur Sports Cover. It provides moderate coverage limits (e.g., $300k Medical, $6k Cancellation).
*   **Elite** also covers Bungee Jumping and Hot Air Ballooning and offers significantly higher coverage limits (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $8k Baggage, $2k Travel Delay max). This aligns better with the customer's requirement for "comprehensive" medical coverage and robust protection against unforeseen events.

Neither Deluxe nor Elite explicitly mention the requested "double payout for accidental death on public transport" in the provided policy details. Since this specific requirement cannot be confirmed as met by either suitable tier based on the available data, the choice focuses on the best fit for the other key requirements.

The customer emphasized comprehensive medical cover and coverage for specific activities. While Deluxe meets the minimum activity requirement, the Elite tier's substantially higher limits across major categories (Medical, Cancellation, Baggage, Travel Delay) provide a more comprehensive safety net, better matching the customer's stated desire for robust protection, especially considering potential medical costs in Australia. Although Elite is the most expensive tier, the customer indicated willingness to spend "a bit more if absolutely necessary" for comprehensive coverage. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule prevents combining features, Elite offers the best single package despite the likely unmet double payout requirement.

Therefore, the **Elite** tier is recommended as the most suitable option, providing the necessary activity coverage and the highest available limits for core benefits like medical emergencies and trip cancellation, aligning best with the customer's priority for comprehensive protection.
