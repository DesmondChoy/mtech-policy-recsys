**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing INCOME's Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers against the customer's requirements:
*   **Classic Tier:** Fails to meet key requirements. It does not offer the requested "Public transport double cover for accidental death" (explicitly stated as N.A.). Furthermore, its coverage for "Adventurous activities" like Bungee Jumping and Hot Air Ballooning is uncertain, as it excludes activities involving height/danger and doesn't explicitly list these specific activities as covered, unlike the higher tiers.
*   **Deluxe Tier:** Meets all core requirements, including comprehensive medical ($500k limit for under 70s), trip cancellation ($10k limit), travel delay, and lost/damaged luggage ($5k limit). Crucially, it explicitly covers both Bungee Jumping and Hot Air Ballooning under its "Adventurous activities" benefit and provides the requested "Public transport double cover for accidental death" ($400k limit for under 70s).
*   **Preferred Tier:** Also meets all core requirements but offers significantly higher limits (e.g., $1M medical, $15k cancellation, $8k luggage, $1M double payout AD&D). It also explicitly covers the required activities.

Both Deluxe and Preferred tiers fulfill all the customer's specific requirements, including the non-negotiable activity coverage and the double payout benefit. The Classic tier is unsuitable due to missing these key coverages. While the Preferred tier offers higher monetary limits, the Deluxe tier provides substantial coverage that meets the definition of "comprehensive" and fulfills every specific request made by the customer. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the choice is between Deluxe and Preferred. Since both tiers are deemed suitable as they meet all stated requirements, the **Tie-Breaking Rule** is applied. Based on the provided price ranking (Classic < Deluxe < Preferred), the Deluxe tier is the cheaper of the two suitable options.

Therefore, the Deluxe tier is recommended as it fully meets all the customer's specific requirements, including activity and double payout cover, at a lower price point than the Preferred tier.
