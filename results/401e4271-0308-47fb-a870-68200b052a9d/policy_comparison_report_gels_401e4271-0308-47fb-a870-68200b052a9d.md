**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers: The Basic tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for "Adventurous leisure activities" (Section 37), which includes the required Bungee Jumping and Hot Air Ballooning, and also does not offer the "Public transport double indemnity" (Section 2) requested by the customer.

Both the Gold and Platinum tiers cover all the customer's specific requirements, including comprehensive medical coverage, trip cancellation, travel delays, lost luggage, adventurous activities (Bungee Jumping, Hot Air Ballooning - Section 37), and the public transport double indemnity (Section 2).

The Platinum tier offers higher monetary limits (e.g., $1M vs $500k for overseas medical, $15k vs $10k for trip cancellation) and a shorter trigger for travel delay compensation (4 hours vs 6 hours). However, the Gold tier already provides substantial limits that meet the definition of "comprehensive" and covers all the explicitly requested items. Given the customer's budget of "around $400" and the No Mix-and-Match rule, the Gold tier represents the most suitable option. It fulfills all stated requirements comprehensively without potentially exceeding the budget for the higher, albeit potentially unnecessary, limits offered by Platinum. Therefore, Gold is selected as the best overall fit, balancing complete coverage of requirements with likely budget alignment.
