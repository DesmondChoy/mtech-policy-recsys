**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All tiers cover the core requirements of Cancellation, Flight Delay, and Luggage Loss/Damage, but differ significantly in their coverage limits. Classic offers the lowest limits (e.g., $5k Cancellation, $3k Luggage), Deluxe offers mid-range limits (e.g., $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage), and Preferred provides the highest limits (e.g., $15k Cancellation, $1M Overseas Medical, $8k Luggage).

Crucially, **none of the standard INCOME tiers (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred) as presented in the provided policy documents cover pre-existing medical conditions like high blood pressure** (See Classic Page 5, Deluxe Page 5, Preferred standard exclusions implied by lack of explicit inclusion and typical policy structure). This is a major gap given the customer's specific requirement. Furthermore, **none of the tiers explicitly mention coverage for additional pet boarding costs** due to travel delays.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must select one complete tier), and acknowledging these significant gaps across all tiers, the Preferred tier is recommended as the *most suitable option among the choices*. This is because the customer requested "comprehensive" coverage, has a "flexible" budget, and the Preferred tier offers the highest monetary limits for the requirements that *are* covered (Cancellation, Medical Expenses [excluding pre-existing conditions], Flight Delay, Luggage). While it fails on pre-existing conditions and pet boarding, it provides the most robust protection for the other stated concerns compared to the Classic and Deluxe tiers. The customer *must* be explicitly informed about the lack of coverage for high blood pressure under this standard plan and the absence of pet boarding coverage. They may need to seek a specific rider for pre-existing conditions if available from INCOME, or consider another insurer.
