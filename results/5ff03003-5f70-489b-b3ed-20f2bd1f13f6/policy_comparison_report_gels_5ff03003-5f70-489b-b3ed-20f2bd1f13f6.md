**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions (like the customer's high blood pressure) and does not offer any coverage for Pet Care (additional pet boarding costs due to delay). These are critical requirements for the customer.
*   **Gold:** This tier offers coverage for all the customer's requirements, including Pet Care. However, coverage for medical expenses, evacuation, cancellation, postponement, or disruption arising from the pre-existing high blood pressure is *only* available if an optional "Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit" is purchased at an additional premium. With this add-on, Gold meets the core needs with substantial limits (e.g., S$500k medical, S$10k cancellation, S$500 pet care). Travel delay payout starts after 6 hours.
*   **Platinum:** Similar to Gold, this tier covers all requirements, including Pet Care, and also requires the purchase of the optional "Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit" for coverage related to high blood pressure. However, Platinum offers significantly higher base coverage limits across the board (e.g., S$1M medical, S$15k cancellation, S$8k luggage, S$800 pet care) and also higher limits for the pre-existing condition coverage via the add-on (e.g., S$200k medical, S$15k cancellation). Additionally, the travel delay payout trigger is shorter (every 4 hours vs. 6 hours for Gold).

Given the customer's desire for "comprehensive" coverage, their flexible budget, the specific mention of a pre-existing condition (high blood pressure), and their emphasis on avoiding coverage gaps after previous negative experiences, the Platinum tier (with the mandatory purchase of the Pre-existing conditions add-on) is recommended. While Gold+Addon meets the minimum requirements, Platinum+Addon provides a superior level of protection and faster benefits for delays, better aligning with the customer's stated need for robust and reliable coverage, thus offering greater peace of mind. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose the entire Platinum package (plus add-on) to get these higher benefits.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Platinum

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides the highest coverage limits offered by GELS for key areas like medical expenses (S$1M base, S$200k pre-existing add-on), cancellation (S$15k base & pre-existing add-on), and luggage loss (S$8k).
    *   Covers all specific customer requirements including Pet Care (S$800 limit) and offers coverage for pre-existing conditions via the mandatory add-on purchase.
    *   Offers a faster payout trigger for travel delays (S$100 per 4 hours).
    *   Includes coverage for adventurous activities (though not required by customer).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Requires the purchase of an additional "Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit" to cover claims related to high blood pressure; this incurs an extra cost.
    *   Claims related to pre-existing conditions under the add-on are subject to specific sub-limits (lower than base limits) and co-payments (50% for cancellation/postponement/disruption, S$100 per outpatient medical visit).
    *   This is the most expensive tier offered by GELS.
