**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO tiers against the customer's requirements for a 3-week UK trip for two adults (41-55) with pre-existing high blood pressure:

*   **Vital Tier:** Offers the lowest limits for cancellation ($5k/person), medical ($150k/person), and luggage ($3k/person). Critically, it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under the Emergency Medical Evacuation benefit and generally excludes them elsewhere, failing a key customer requirement.
*   **Deluxe Tier:** Provides higher limits than Vital (e.g., $300k medical, $6k cancellation). Importantly, it includes coverage for pre-existing conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation up to $100k per person (under 70), partially addressing the high blood pressure concern. However, it does not explicitly cover pet boarding costs.
*   **GO Japan! Tier:** While offering limits similar or slightly better than Deluxe in some areas, this tier is specifically designed and marketed for travel to Japan, including Japan-specific assistance services. It is therefore unsuitable for a trip to the UK.
*   **Elite Tier:** Offers the highest limits across all key areas: Medical Overseas ($1M/person), Cancellation ($15k/person), Luggage ($8k/person), and Travel Delay ($2k max). Crucially, it provides the highest coverage limit for pre-existing conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation ($150k/person under 70). Like the Deluxe tier, it does not explicitly mention coverage for pet boarding costs.

The customer requires "comprehensive" coverage, specifically mentioning concerns about cancellation, medical (including high blood pressure), flight delays, luggage, and pet boarding. The No Mix-and-Match rule requires selecting a single tier.

While no tier explicitly covers the requested pet boarding costs, the Elite tier provides the most robust coverage for all other stated requirements. It offers significantly higher financial protection and the best available coverage for pre-existing conditions under the critical Medical Evacuation benefit compared to the Deluxe tier. Although the Vital tier is the cheapest, its exclusion of pre-existing condition coverage makes it unsuitable.

Therefore, the **Elite** tier is recommended as the single best fit, offering the most comprehensive protection and highest limits for the customer's primary concerns, particularly acknowledging the pre-existing condition for evacuation purposes, despite the gap in pet boarding coverage across all tiers.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Highest coverage limits for Medical Expenses Overseas ($1M/person), Trip Cancellation ($15k/person), Luggage ($8k/person), and Travel Delay ($2k max).
    *   Provides explicit coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation (up to $150k for under 70s), addressing the customer's high blood pressure concern for this critical benefit.
    *   Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation limit for standard (non-pre-existing) conditions for those under 70.
    *   Travel Delay covers delays for any cause beyond the insured's control.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Pet Boarding Coverage: This specific requirement is not covered under any listed benefit.
    *   Medical Coverage (Pre-existing Conditions): While covered for Emergency Evacuation up to a sub-limit, standard Medical Expenses Overseas coverage for pre-existing conditions (like high blood pressure) may still be subject to general policy exclusions unless the situation is life-threatening. This should be clarified further.
