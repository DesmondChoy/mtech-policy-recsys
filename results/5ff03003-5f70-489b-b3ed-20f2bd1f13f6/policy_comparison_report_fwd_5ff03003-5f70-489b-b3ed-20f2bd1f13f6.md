**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers offer base coverage for cancellation, medical, flight delay, and luggage, but require the purchase of optional add-ons for the customer's specific needs regarding pre-existing high blood pressure ('Pre-existing medical conditions' cover) and pet boarding costs due to delay ('Pet care' cover).

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits overall (e.g., $7.5k Cancellation, $200k Overseas Medical, $50k Pre-ex Medical with add-on). While cheapest, these limits may not align with the customer's desire for "comprehensive" and "proper" coverage, especially given the pre-existing condition and long-haul trip.
*   **Business:** Provides a significant step up in limits (e.g., $10k Cancellation, $500k Overseas Medical, $100k Pre-ex Medical with add-on, $100k Pre-ex Evacuation). This offers good coverage.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $15k Cancellation, $1M Overseas Medical, $150k Pre-ex Medical with add-on, $150k Pre-ex Evacuation). It also has the highest flight delay ($1000) and luggage ($7500) limits.

Given the customer's emphasis on "proper coverage", "no excuses", addressing the pre-existing condition, covering pet boarding, and past negative experiences, the higher limits and comprehensive nature of the **First** tier provide the greatest peace of mind and best align with the stated requirements, despite being the most expensive option. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose a single tier, and First (with the necessary add-ons) most completely addresses all concerns with the highest available protection levels from FWD.
