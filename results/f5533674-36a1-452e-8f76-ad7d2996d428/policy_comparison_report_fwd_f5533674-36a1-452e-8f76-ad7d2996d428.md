**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for this customer's golf trip to Australia:

*   **Core Coverage & Limits:** The customer requires "comprehensive coverage". First tier offers significantly higher limits than Premium and Business across key areas: Medical Expenses Overseas ($1M vs $500k vs $200k), Trip Cancellation ($15k vs $10k vs $7.5k), Baggage ($7.5k vs $5k vs $3k), and Personal Liability ($1M vs $750k vs $500k). First also includes Car Rental Excess cover ($1k) as standard, whereas it's optional ($300) on Premium and standard ($500) on Business.
*   **Pre-existing Conditions (High Blood Pressure):** This is a critical requirement. All tiers offer an *optional* 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on which *must* be purchased. First provides the highest medical expense limit under this add-on ($150k vs $100k for Business vs $50k with 50% co-pay for Premium) and a high evacuation limit ($150k). While Premium offers unlimited evacuation for pre-existing conditions, its significantly lower medical expense limit with co-payment makes it less suitable for someone prioritizing comprehensive medical cover.
*   **Golf-Specific Requirements:**
    *   **Golf Equipment:** All tiers require the purchase of the *optional* 'Sports equipment protector' add-on ($2000 limit). This covers theft/damage/loss but explicitly *excludes damage occurring while the equipment is in use*. This gap exists regardless of the tier chosen.
    *   **Unused Green Fees:** None of the tiers specifically cover reimbursement for unused green fees due to injury or weather. Claims might be possible under Trip Disruption/Cut Short for *unused non-refundable costs* if the cause aligns with policy definitions, but this is not guaranteed or specific to green fees. This gap exists across all tiers.
    *   **Golf Buggy Damage:** None of the tiers cover accidental damage to a rented golf buggy. Personal Liability excludes motorised vehicles, and Car Rental Excess applies only to licensed rental cars. This gap exists across all tiers.
    *   **Hole-in-One Benefit:** None of the tiers offer a hole-in-one benefit. This gap exists across all tiers.
*   **No Mix-and-Match:** The customer must select one complete tier.

**Conclusion:** While no FWD tier perfectly meets *all* the specific golf-related requests (unused green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one), the **First** tier provides the highest level of core protection, aligning best with the request for "comprehensive coverage" and "premium service". Its superior limits for medical (including the crucial pre-existing condition add-on), cancellation, baggage, and liability, plus included car rental excess, make it the most robust option. The unavoidable gaps in niche golf coverage are consistent across all tiers, making the higher core limits of the First tier the deciding factor. The customer must purchase the 'Pre-existing medical conditions' and 'Sports equipment protector' add-ons with this tier.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Golfing as an activity is generally covered under the policy for medical/liability etc. (subject to standard exclusions). Specific golf equipment cover requires the optional add-on, which has limitations (damage during use exclusion, $2k limit). Other specific golf benefits (green fees, buggy, hole-in-one) are not covered.
