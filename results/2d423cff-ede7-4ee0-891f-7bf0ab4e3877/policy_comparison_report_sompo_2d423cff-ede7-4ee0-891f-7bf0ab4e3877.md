**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, and Elite tiers against the customer's requirements for a 2-week trip to Japan including skiing:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it does not explicitly cover recreational skiing, a key activity requirement. Its coverage limits are also significantly lower across the board.
*   **Deluxe:** Covers recreational skiing and core requirements (Medical $300k, Cancellation $6k, PA $250k). However, its limits are lower than GO Japan! and Elite.
*   **GO Japan!:** Specifically designed for Japan travel, it covers recreational skiing and offers higher medical limits ($500k) than Deluxe, plus the benefit of cashless medical services in Japan. Cancellation ($6k) and PA ($250k) limits are the same as Deluxe.
*   **Elite:** Offers the highest coverage limits across all key areas requested by the customer (Medical $1M, Cancellation $15k, PA $500k, Luggage $8k) and explicitly covers recreational skiing.

The customer requested "Comprehensive emergency medical coverage" and coverage for several other risks. While GO Japan! offers the convenient cashless service in Japan, the Elite tier provides significantly higher limits, better aligning with the request for "comprehensive" protection, especially for medical expenses, trip cancellation, and personal accident.

Crucially, the specific request for "Double payout for accidental death while traveling on public transport" is **not explicitly mentioned or confirmed** in the provided policy details for *any* of the SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite).

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. Although no tier meets the double indemnity requirement based on the provided data, the Elite tier offers the most robust coverage for all other stated requirements, particularly the high limits desired for comprehensive medical, cancellation, personal accident, and luggage cover, along with the necessary skiing coverage. Therefore, Elite is recommended as the best overall fit despite the gap regarding the double indemnity request.
