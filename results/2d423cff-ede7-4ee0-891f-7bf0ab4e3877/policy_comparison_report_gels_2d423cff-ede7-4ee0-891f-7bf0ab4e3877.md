**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers against the customer's requirements for a 2-week trip to Japan including skiing:

*   **Basic Tier:** Fails to meet key requirements. It explicitly excludes coverage for 'Adventurous leisure activities' (Page 5, Section 37), meaning recreational skiing would not be covered. Furthermore, it does not offer 'Public transport double indemnity' (Page 3, Section 2). Therefore, the Basic tier is unsuitable.
*   **Gold Tier:** Meets all specified requirements. It provides comprehensive medical coverage ($500k overseas), trip cancellation ($10k), travel delay ($100 per 6 hours), lost luggage ($5k), and personal accident ($250k). Crucially, it covers 'Adventurous leisure activities' (Page 5, Section 37), which includes recreational skiing, and provides 'Public transport double indemnity' ($500k) as requested (Page 3, Section 2).
*   **Platinum Tier:** Also meets all specified requirements, offering higher limits ($1M medical, $15k cancellation, $8k luggage, $500k PA, $1M double indemnity). It includes coverage for 'Adventurous leisure activities' (Page 5, Section 37) and adds specific 'Sports equipment cover' ($1k) (Page 5, Section 33), which Gold lacks. It also has a shorter trigger for travel delay (4 hours vs 6 hours).

**Selection Rationale:** Both Gold and Platinum tiers fulfill all the customer's stated requirements, including the critical need for skiing coverage and public transport double indemnity. The Basic tier is eliminated due to lacking these coverages. While Platinum offers higher limits and additional benefits like specific sports equipment cover and a shorter delay trigger, the Gold tier adequately meets all the requirements as specified by the customer (e.g., delay cover requested for >6 hours, medical cover for skiing requested, not equipment cover). Since both Gold and Platinum are suitable options covering the core needs and the No Mix-and-Match rule prevents combining features, the Tie-Breaking Rule is applied. Gold appears before Platinum in the price ranking (Cheapest to Most Expensive). Therefore, the Gold tier is recommended as the most suitable and cost-effective option that meets all specified requirements.
