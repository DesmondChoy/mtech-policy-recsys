**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the customer's trip to Japan: All tiers cover the core requirements like medical expenses, trip cancellation, travel delay (as a cash benefit), lost luggage, personal accident, and implicitly cover recreational skiing as it's not listed as a general exclusion for medical/accident claims. The primary differences lie in the coverage limits. Premium offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Medical Overseas, $7.5k Cancellation, $3k Luggage, $200k PA). Business significantly increases these limits (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage, $300k PA). First offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Cancellation, $7.5k Luggage, $400k PA).

A key customer requirement is "Comprehensive emergency medical coverage". While Premium's $200k limit might be considered low for comprehensive cover, especially with skiing in Japan, both the Business ($500k) and First ($1M) tiers provide substantially higher limits that align well with this requirement. Another specific request was for a "Double payout for accidental death while traveling on public transport". **Crucially, none of the provided FWD tiers (Premium, Business, or First) explicitly state coverage for this double indemnity benefit within their Personal Accident sections.**

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. Since the double indemnity requirement cannot be met by any tier, the decision focuses on the best fit for the remaining requirements, particularly the need for comprehensive medical cover suitable for skiing. Both Business and First tiers offer robust medical limits ($500k and $1M respectively) that meet the "comprehensive" criteria adequately for a 26-40 year old with no pre-existing conditions undertaking recreational skiing. As both Business and First are deemed suitable for providing the required comprehensive coverage level (with Business's $500k being a strong limit), the Tie-Breaking Rule is applied. According to the provided price ranking (Premium < Business < First), Business is the cheaper option among the suitable tiers.

Therefore, the Business tier is recommended as it provides a strong level of comprehensive coverage (especially medical at $500k) suitable for the customer's profile, destination, and activities, at a better price point than the First tier, while acknowledging that the specific double indemnity request is not met by any available FWD tier.
