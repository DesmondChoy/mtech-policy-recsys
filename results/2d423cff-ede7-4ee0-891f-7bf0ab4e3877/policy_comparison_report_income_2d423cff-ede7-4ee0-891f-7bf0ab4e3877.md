**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All three tiers cover the core requirements like medical expenses, trip cancellation, travel delay, lost luggage, and personal accident, albeit with varying limits. All tiers also cover recreational skiing under their 'Adventurous activities' benefit, provided safety conditions are met.

However, a key specific requirement is the "Double payout for accidental death while traveling on public transport". The Classic tier explicitly states this benefit is 'NA' (Not Available) under its Personal Accident coverage, making it unsuitable despite being the cheapest. Both the Deluxe and Preferred tiers include this 'Public transport double cover' benefit under their Personal Accident section.

The Deluxe tier offers substantial limits (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Cancellation, $200k Personal Accident base, $400k PA with double cover). The Preferred tier offers significantly higher limits across the board (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Cancellation, $500k Personal Accident base, $1M PA with double cover).

Since both Deluxe and Preferred tiers fulfill all the customer's stated requirements, including the mandatory recreational skiing and public transport double indemnity cover, they are considered equally suitable in meeting the core needs. According to the Tie-Breaking Rule, when multiple tiers are equally suitable, the tier appearing earliest in the price ranking (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred) must be selected.

Therefore, the **Deluxe** tier is recommended as it fully meets all specified requirements, including the crucial double indemnity cover (unlike Classic), and is the cheaper option compared to the Preferred tier based on the provided price ranking and tie-breaking rule.
