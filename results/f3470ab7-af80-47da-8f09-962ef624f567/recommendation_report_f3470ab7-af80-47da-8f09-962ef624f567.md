# Travel Insurance Recommendation for Customer f3470ab7-af80-47da-8f09-962ef624f567

---

## Final Recommendation
Based on a detailed analysis of your requirements against available policies, the recommended policy is:

**SOMPO - Elite**

### Justification
The customer explicitly and repeatedly prioritized comprehensive golf coverage as the 'main thing' for their trip to Thailand, specifically requesting cover for: 1) golf equipment loss/damage, 2) unused green fees reimbursement, 3) liability for golf buggy damage ('crucially'), and 4) a hole-in-one benefit. They also indicated a flexible budget, prioritizing the 'right cover' over cost. Standard coverages (medical, cancellation, delay, baggage) were required but secondary in emphasis.

Comparing the finalists:
1.  **FWD Business:** This policy is unsuitable. Despite good core coverage, it fundamentally fails to meet the customer's primary requirements. It requires an optional add-on ('Sports equipment protector', Page 9) just for equipment cover (which excludes damage during play, Page 29), and completely lacks specific cover for unused green fees, hole-in-one, and crucially, golf buggy liability (explicitly excluded under Personal Liability's motorised vehicle exclusion, Page 17).
2.  **GELS Platinum:** This is a strong policy with high core limits and dedicated 'Golfer's cover' (Page 5, Section 32) addressing equipment (S$1k), unused green fees (S$250), and hole-in-one (S$250). Buggy liability is addressed indirectly but effectively via high Rental Vehicle Excess (S$1.5k, Page 5, Section 31) and Personal Liability (S$1M, Page 5, Section 36). It meets all requirements.
3.  **SOMPO Elite:** This policy also offers high core limits comparable to GELS Platinum. Critically, it features a dedicated 'Golf Cover' section (Page 6, Section 36) that explicitly addresses *all four* of the customer's specific golf requirements: Loss/damage of golf equipment (S$1k), Unused green fees (S$250), Hole-in-one (S$500), and importantly, 'Damage of buggy' (S$500). 

The key differentiator favoring **SOMPO Elite** is its explicit and consolidated coverage for all prioritized golf needs within a single section (Section 36). The specific listing of 'Damage of buggy' directly addresses the customer's 'crucial' concern with greater clarity than GELS's reliance on Rental Vehicle Excess, even though GELS's limit is higher. Furthermore, SOMPO Elite offers double the hole-in-one benefit (S$500 vs S$250) compared to GELS Platinum. While GELS Platinum has a slightly better travel delay trigger, this is less significant than SOMPO Elite's superior alignment with the customer's primary, heavily emphasized golf coverage requirements. Given the customer's prioritization and flexible budget, SOMPO Elite provides the most direct, comprehensive, and clearly articulated solution for their specific needs.
