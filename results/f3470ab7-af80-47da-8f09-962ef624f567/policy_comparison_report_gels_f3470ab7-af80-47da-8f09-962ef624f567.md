**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers: The Basic tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes all specific golf-related coverages requested by the customer (golf equipment, unused green fees, hole-in-one benefit) under its "Golfer's cover" section, which states "Not covered". The Gold tier meets the minimum requirements, offering core travel protections and dedicated "Golfer's cover" including S$500 for equipment, S$250 for unused green fees, and S$250 for a hole-in-one, plus S$1,000 for rental vehicle excess (relevant for buggy damage). However, the Platinum tier provides significantly higher limits for core benefits (e.g., S$1M vs S$500k for overseas medical, S$15k vs S$10k for trip cancellation, S$8k vs S$5k for baggage loss) and also enhances the specific golf-related coverages. Platinum offers double the golf equipment cover (S$1,000 vs S$500) and a higher rental vehicle excess limit (S$1,500 vs S$1,000), which directly addresses the customer's concern about golf buggy damage liability more robustly. Platinum also features a better travel delay payout basis (S$100 per 4 hours vs S$100 per 6 hours).

Given the customer's emphasis on comprehensive golf coverage, flexible budget, and need for the "right cover quickly," the Platinum tier is the single most suitable option. It is the only tier that fully addresses all requirements with the highest available protection levels for both standard travel risks and the specific golfing needs, particularly the higher limits for golf equipment and rental vehicle excess/buggy damage. The No Mix-and-Match rule necessitates choosing a single tier, and Platinum provides the most complete and robust package offered by GELS for this customer's specific profile and requests.
