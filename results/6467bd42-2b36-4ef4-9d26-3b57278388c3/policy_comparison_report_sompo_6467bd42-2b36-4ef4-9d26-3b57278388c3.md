**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, and Elite tiers for the customer's trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation (Section 4) and does not explicitly mention coverage for amateur sports like hiking, which is a key requirement. Limits are also significantly lower across the board.
*   **Deluxe:** Offers a baseline level of acceptable coverage. It includes hiking ("trekking up to 3,500m") and provides Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation cover for pre-existing conditions up to $100k. However, its overall medical ($300k) and cancellation ($6k) limits are moderate.
*   **GO Japan!:** Similar to Deluxe in most respects, including hiking cover and the $100k pre-existing condition evacuation limit. It offers a higher overseas medical limit ($500k) and Japan-specific cashless medical services. However, other limits (Cancellation, Luggage) are the same as Deluxe, and it comes at a higher price point than Deluxe.
*   **Elite:** Provides the highest coverage limits across all key areas: $1M for overseas medical, $15k for trip cancellation, $8k for luggage, and $2k max for travel delay. Crucially for the customer's concern about asthma, it offers the highest sub-limit for Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation due to pre-existing conditions ($150k). It also explicitly covers hiking ("trekking up to 3,500m").

**Reasoning for Recommendation:**
The customer explicitly stated that "Getting the right cover is more important than saving a few dollars" and expressed significant worry about medical expenses, particularly related to pre-existing asthma, as well as hiking risks. While no tier will cover trip cancellation solely for attending a planned wedding, the Elite tier provides the most comprehensive protection and highest limits for the other major concerns. The significantly higher medical limits ($1M) and the higher sub-limit for pre-existing condition evacuation ($150k) offer the greatest peace of mind regarding potential asthma-related emergencies (even if general treatment is likely limited to life-threatening situations). The explicit coverage for hiking and the highest limits for luggage and travel delay further align with the desire for robust coverage. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, Elite is the single tier that best addresses the combination of requirements and the customer's stated priority for comprehensive cover over cost, despite being the most expensive option.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Provides high limit trip cancellation coverage for standard 'Insured Events' (e.g., death/serious injury/illness of traveller or close relative, strike, natural disaster). However, it does *not* cover cancellation for the specific reason requested (attending sister's wedding), as this is typically not considered an unforeseen Insured Event under standard policy terms.

### Requirement: Pre-existing conditions (Asthma)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation (Including Mortal Remains) Back to Singapore
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person - up to 70 years', 'limit': 'Unlimited', 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - above 70 years', 'limit': 150000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - up to 70 years (Pre-existing Conditions)', 'limit': 150000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - above 70 years (Pre-existing Conditions)', 'limit': 75000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 'No aggregate limit', 'basis': None}]

*   **Policy Coverage:** Medical Expenses Incurred Overseas
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person - 70 years & below', 'limit': 1000000, 'basis': None}, ...] *(See Medical Expenses section above for full details)*
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** *(No specific mention of pre-existing condition coverage under this section in the provided JSON, implying standard exclusions likely apply unless life-threatening)*
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Provides the highest available sub-limit ($150k for under 70s) for Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation specifically due to pre-existing conditions. However, general medical expenses (outpatient/hospitalisation) arising from pre-existing asthma are typically excluded from standard travel insurance unless it's a life-threatening emergency situation. This needs explicit clarification based on the full policy wording, but based on standard practice and the provided data, full medical treatment cover for asthma is unlikely.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Highest overall limits for Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), Luggage ($8k), and Travel Delay ($2k max).
    *   Highest sub-limit for Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation due to Pre-existing Conditions ($150k for under 70s), addressing a key customer concern.
    *   Explicitly covers Hiking/Trekking up to 3,500m under Amateur Sports Cover.
    *   Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for non-pre-existing conditions (under 70s).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip Cancellation: Does not cover cancellation for the specific reason of attending a planned family event (sister's wedding).
    *   Pre-existing Conditions (Asthma): While emergency evacuation is covered up to a limit, general medical treatment (doctor visits, non-emergency hospitalisation) specifically for asthma is likely excluded unless life-threatening (standard policy exclusion).
    *   Highest price point among the available tiers.
