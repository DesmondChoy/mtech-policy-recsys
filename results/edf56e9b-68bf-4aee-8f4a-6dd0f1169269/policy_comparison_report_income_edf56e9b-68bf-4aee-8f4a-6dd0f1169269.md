**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All three standard tiers cover key requirements like Trip Cancellation, Lost Luggage, Travel Delay (as a cash benefit), and Scuba Diving (under Adventurous Activities, subject to conditions). However, a critical requirement is comprehensive medical coverage including issues related to the pre-existing condition of high blood pressure. Based on the provided policy details, **all three standard tiers (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred) explicitly state that standard plans do not cover pre-existing medical conditions.** This represents a significant gap across all available options presented. Additionally, none of the tiers offer the requested coverage for additional pet accommodation costs due to travel delays.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. Since the exclusion for pre-existing conditions and the lack of pet cover apply universally to these standard tiers, the decision hinges on which tier best aligns with the desire for "comprehensive" coverage in other areas and offers the highest limits for the covered risks.

The Preferred tier provides the highest benefit limits across most categories compared to Classic and Deluxe:
*   **Medical Expenses Overseas:** $1,000,000 (Preferred) vs $500,000 (Deluxe) vs $250,000 (Classic) for adults under 70 (though pre-existing conditions are excluded).
*   **Trip Cancellation:** $15,000 (Preferred) vs $10,000 (Deluxe) vs $5,000 (Classic).
*   **Lost/Damaged Luggage:** $8,000 (Preferred) vs $5,000 (Deluxe) vs $3,000 (Classic).
*   **Travel Delay:** Max $2,000 (Preferred) vs $1,500 (Deluxe) vs $1,000 (Classic).

Therefore, despite the major shortcoming regarding pre-existing condition coverage and the absence of pet accommodation cover, the **Preferred** tier is recommended as it offers the most comprehensive coverage levels and highest limits for the other requested benefits (Medical, Cancellation, Luggage, Delay, Scuba Diving) among the three standard options provided. The customer MUST be made aware of the significant gaps, particularly the lack of cover for medical issues arising from high blood pressure under this standard plan. They may need to inquire about specific riders or alternative policies if pre-existing condition coverage is non-negotiable.
