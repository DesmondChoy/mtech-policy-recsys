**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO Vital, Deluxe, and Elite tiers for the customer's trip to Thailand (GO Japan! tier is excluded as it's destination-specific):

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for Leisure Underwater Activities (scuba diving) and does not cover pre-existing medical conditions, even for emergency evacuation. This fails two critical customer requirements.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier covers Leisure Underwater Activities (scuba diving) and provides coverage for pre-existing conditions specifically for Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation (up to $100k for under 70s). It meets the core requirements for medical, cancellation, luggage, and travel delay. However, the limits are lower than Elite (e.g., $300k Medical, $6k Cancellation).
*   **Elite:** This tier also covers Leisure Underwater Activities (scuba diving) with a higher aggregate limit ($350k). It provides a higher limit for pre-existing conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation ($150k for under 70s). Crucially, it offers significantly higher overall limits, aligning better with the request for "comprehensive" coverage (Medical $1M, Cancellation $15k, Luggage $8k).

**Decision:** While both Deluxe and Elite cover scuba diving and offer *limited* pre-existing condition coverage (focused on evacuation/repatriation), the Elite tier is recommended. The customer emphasized comprehensive medical coverage and concern about high blood pressure. Elite's substantially higher medical limits ($1M vs $300k) and higher evacuation sub-limit for pre-existing conditions ($150k vs $100k) provide a more robust safety net, better addressing these primary concerns. The higher limits for cancellation and luggage are also beneficial. Although Elite is the most expensive option, its superior coverage levels make it the most suitable choice given the specific requirements. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer cannot combine the lower price of Deluxe with higher limits from Elite; therefore, choosing the tier that best meets the comprehensive needs is paramount. It's important to note that neither tier appears to cover general *treatment* costs for pre-existing conditions based on the provided data, and neither covers the specific request for pet accommodation costs.
