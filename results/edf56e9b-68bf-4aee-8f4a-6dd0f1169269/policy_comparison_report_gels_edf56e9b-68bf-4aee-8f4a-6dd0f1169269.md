**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers against the customer's requirements:

*   **Basic Tier:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions (like high blood pressure), adventurous leisure activities (including scuba diving), and pet care due to travel delays. These are all mandatory requirements for the customer.
*   **Gold Tier:** This tier covers adventurous leisure activities (scuba diving) and pet care in its standard benefits. Crucially, it offers an optional "Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit" (requiring additional premium) which can provide coverage for the customer's high blood pressure for medical expenses, trip cancellation/disruption, and other related benefits, subject to specific limits and co-payments. With this add-on, the Gold tier addresses all specified requirements, including medical, travel delay, luggage, and cancellation.
*   **Platinum Tier:** Similar to Gold, this tier covers scuba diving and pet care standardly and also offers the optional "Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit" (at additional premium) to cover high blood pressure. Platinum provides higher coverage limits across most benefits (e.g., medical, cancellation, luggage, pet care) and a shorter trigger time for travel delay (4 hours vs 6 hours for Gold).

**Selection Rationale:** Both the Gold and Platinum tiers, *when combined with the mandatory purchase of the Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit*, can meet all the customer's stated requirements (medical, pre-existing condition, scuba diving, travel delay, pet care, luggage, cancellation). The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose one tier entirely. Since both Gold (+AddOn) and Platinum (+AddOn) fulfill the checklist of required coverage types, they are considered equally suitable in meeting the core needs. Applying the Tie-Breaking Rule, the tier appearing earliest in the price ranking (cheapest among equally suitable) is selected. Therefore, the **Gold** tier is recommended. This choice also aligns better with the customer's indicative budget of "around $400", as the Platinum tier plus the add-on would likely be significantly more expensive.

**IMPORTANT:** This recommendation is contingent on the customer purchasing the **"Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit"** alongside the Gold tier policy. Without this add-on, the Gold tier will NOT cover medical issues or cancellations related to high blood pressure.
