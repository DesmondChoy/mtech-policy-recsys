**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the couple's trip to Thailand:

*   **Premium:** While the cheapest, its coverage limits are relatively low, particularly for key requirements like pre-existing medical expenses (add-on limit $50k), trip cancellation ($7.5k), travel delay ($300), and luggage ($3k). This may not meet the customer's need for "comprehensive" coverage, especially concerning the pre-existing high blood pressure. Although its pre-existing condition evacuation limit is stated as Unlimited (which is unusually high and might be an anomaly in the data), the medical expense limit is low.
*   **Business:** Offers a significant step up in coverage limits compared to Premium: $500k base medical ($100k pre-ex add-on limit), $10k trip cancellation, $500 travel delay, and $5k luggage. These higher limits provide a more robust safety net, better aligning with the "comprehensive" requirement. It covers all specified needs, including scuba diving (leisure) and pet accommodation (via add-on). The $100k pre-existing condition evacuation limit is substantial.
*   **First:** Provides the highest limits ($1M base medical, $150k pre-ex add-on limit, $15k trip cancellation, $1k travel delay, $7.5k luggage). While offering the most coverage, it is also the most expensive tier. Given the customer's budget of around $400, and the necessity of purchasing *two* additional cost options (Pre-existing Medical Conditions and Pet Care), the First tier plus add-ons is likely to exceed the budget significantly.

**Conclusion:** The Business tier strikes the best balance. It addresses all the customer's requirements (including the crucial pre-existing condition and pet care via mandatory add-ons) with significantly better coverage limits than Premium, making it more "comprehensive". It remains more budget-conscious than the First tier, making it the most suitable holistic choice based on the requirements, the No Mix-and-Match rule, and the likely budget constraints.
