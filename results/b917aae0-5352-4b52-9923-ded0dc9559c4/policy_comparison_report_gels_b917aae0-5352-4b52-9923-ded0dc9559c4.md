**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers against David Tan's requirements for his two-week trip to Japan:

*   **Basic Tier:** This tier is unsuitable. It explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure, does not offer the requested Public Transport Double Indemnity, and does not cover adventurous leisure activities like Hiking. These are critical failures against the customer's core needs.
*   **Gold Tier:** This tier covers most requirements, including Public Transport Double Indemnity and Hiking ("Adventurous leisure activities"). Crucially, it offers an *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions (including high blood pressure) which would cover medical expenses, evacuation, and trip cancellation/disruption related to the condition, albeit with specific limits and co-payments. It also includes "Travel inconvenience for any reason" coverage, partially addressing the customer's concern about loopholes. However, the coverage limits ($500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage, $500k Double Indemnity) and the travel delay trigger (6 hours) are lower than the Platinum tier.
*   **Platinum Tier:** This tier also covers all core requirements, including Public Transport Double Indemnity and Hiking. Like Gold, it requires the purchase of the *optional add-on* to cover the pre-existing high blood pressure, offering higher limits ($1M Medical, $200k Pre-ex Medical, $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage, $1M Double Indemnity). It features a shorter travel delay trigger (4 hours vs. 6 hours for Gold) and higher limits for "Travel inconvenience for any reason" coverage.

**Reasoning for Selection:** While both Gold and Platinum can meet the requirements *if the pre-existing condition add-on is purchased*, the Platinum tier is recommended as the single most suitable option. The customer explicitly requested "comprehensive" coverage and expressed significant concern about policy loopholes due to past negative experiences. Platinum's significantly higher coverage limits across key areas (Medical, Cancellation, Luggage, Double Indemnity) and the more favourable travel delay trigger (4 hours) better align with this expressed need for robust, comprehensive protection and minimizing potential coverage gaps or "loopholes". Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, selecting the tier that most comprehensively addresses the customer's stated priorities, including the desire for strong coverage, makes Platinum the superior choice over Gold, even though Gold technically meets the base requirements with the add-on. The Tie-Breaking rule is not invoked as Platinum is deemed *more* suitable, not just equally suitable, based on the customer's emphasis.
