**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against Mr. Tan's requirements for his 2-week trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable. It explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation (Section 4) and does not appear to cover amateur sports like Hiking (Page 2/5). It also has the lowest coverage limits overall.
*   **Deluxe:** Offers moderate coverage limits ($300k Medical, $6k Cancellation, $5k Luggage). It covers Hiking (trekking up to 3,500m) and provides limited cover ($100k) for Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation related to pre-existing conditions. However, its limits are significantly lower than Elite, and it doesn't meet the double AD payout request. General medical expenses for pre-existing conditions are likely excluded.
*   **GO Japan!:** Specifically designed for Japan, offering higher Overseas Medical ($500k) than Deluxe and cashless medical services in Japan via EAJ, which is a strong advantage. It covers Hiking and pre-existing condition evacuation ($100k limit). However, its other limits (Cancellation $6k, Luggage $5k) are similar to Deluxe and much lower than Elite. It also fails to meet the double AD payout request, and general medical expenses for pre-existing conditions are likely excluded.
*   **Elite:** Provides the highest coverage limits across all key areas ($1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage, $500k Personal Accident, $2k Travel Delay). It covers Hiking and offers the highest limit ($150k) for Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation related to pre-existing conditions among the tiers that cover it.

**Conclusion:** While no tier meets the specific "double payout for accidental death on public transport" request, and none appear to cover *general* medical expenses for pre-existing conditions (only emergency evacuation/repatriation), the Elite tier provides the most comprehensive protection overall. Its significantly higher limits align best with the customer's desire for "comprehensive", "iron-clad" coverage and "rigorous avoidance of loopholes". Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the superior limits of Elite make it the most suitable choice despite the shared gaps on specific requirements. The GO Japan! plan's cashless feature is appealing, but its lower limits in other areas make it less comprehensive than Elite.

Therefore, the Elite tier is recommended as it offers the highest level of protection across the board for the customer's core requirements, including the highest available cover for pre-existing condition evacuation and explicit coverage for hiking.
