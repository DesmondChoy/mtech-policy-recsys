**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers cover the core requirements of Medical, Luggage, Travel Delay, Trip Cancellation, and Personal Accident. However, they differ significantly in coverage limits and included benefits. The customer requires comprehensive medical coverage, including for a pre-existing condition (high blood pressure), coverage for hiking, and specifically requested a double payout for accidental death on public transport.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Medical Overseas, $7.5k Cancellation). While it offers an optional pre-existing condition add-on, the medical coverage under this add-on is limited to $50k (with 50% co-pay), which may not meet the customer's need for "comprehensive" coverage in Japan.
*   **Business:** Provides higher limits than Premium (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Cancellation) and includes Car Rental Excess cover. The optional pre-existing condition add-on offers $100k for medical expenses and $100k for evacuation, a significant improvement over Premium.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits across all categories (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Cancellation, $7.5k Luggage) and includes Car Rental Excess. Crucially, its optional pre-existing condition add-on provides the highest medical coverage ($150k) and evacuation ($150k) among the tiers. This best aligns with the customer's requirement for "comprehensive" medical coverage, especially considering the pre-existing condition and the desire to avoid loopholes (often perceived in lower-limit policies).

None of the FWD tiers explicitly state a double payout for accidental death on public transport based on the provided policy details. Hiking is generally covered as a leisure activity, assuming it's non-professional.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. While Business offers good coverage, the First tier's significantly higher limits, particularly for standard medical expenses and the crucial pre-existing condition medical coverage ($150k vs $100k in Business), make it the most suitable choice to meet the customer's emphasis on comprehensive protection and minimizing potential coverage gaps. Therefore, the First tier is recommended as it provides the best overall fit for the stated requirements, despite the lack of the specific double PA payout feature. The tie-breaking rule was not required as First provides superior coverage for key requirements compared to Business. *Note: The customer must purchase the 'Pre-existing medical conditions' optional cover with the First tier policy.*
