**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers offer optional coverage for pre-existing conditions, which is essential for the customer's high blood pressure requirement. Hiking is generally covered as a leisure activity under standard terms across all tiers, provided it's not professional or against local advice (specific exclusion details requested are typically found in full policy wording, not the summary JSON). The key differentiators lie in the coverage limits and included benefits.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Medical, $7.5k Cancellation, $50k Pre-existing Medical add-on). While it meets basic needs and offers the necessary add-ons, the limits might not align with the customer's desire for a "comprehensive" plan. Car rental excess cover is optional.
*   **Business:** Provides a significant step up in limits ($500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $100k Pre-existing Medical add-on, $100k Pre-existing Evacuation add-on). It offers a strong balance between coverage levels and potential cost. It also includes Car Rental Excess cover as standard.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits ($1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $150k Pre-existing Medical add-on, $150k Pre-existing Evacuation add-on) and includes Car Rental Excess. This provides the most coverage but is also the most expensive tier.

The customer's specific request for double indemnity for accidental death on public transport is *not* explicitly mentioned as a feature in the Personal Accident benefit details provided for *any* of the tiers. Therefore, this requirement cannot be met based on the available data and does not differentiate the tiers. Similarly, specific details like the definition of 'close family member', granular claim procedures, specific electronics exclusions beyond laptops/phones, covered expenses for travel delay, and specific hiking exclusions require reference to the full policy wording not present in the JSON extracts.

Considering the need for comprehensive coverage, especially for pre-existing conditions, the Business tier offers substantially better protection than Premium. While First provides even higher limits, the Business tier's limits (e.g., $100k for pre-existing medical expenses and $100k for pre-existing evacuation) are robust and represent a good balance, likely meeting the need for comprehensive cover without potentially exceeding the budget as much as the First tier might. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose the entire package; Business provides a well-rounded package with higher limits than Premium and includes car rental excess.

Therefore, the **Business** tier is recommended as the most suitable option, providing a comprehensive level of coverage, significantly higher limits than Premium for key areas including the essential pre-existing condition add-on, while likely being more budget-conscious than the First tier.
