**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions (a key requirement for the customer's high blood pressure), does not offer public transport double indemnity, and does not cover adventurous leisure activities like hiking.
*   **Gold:** This tier covers hiking and public transport double indemnity. It offers an *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions (including high blood pressure) which would meet that core requirement, albeit with specific limits (e.g., S$150k medical overseas for adult <70) and co-payments for trip changes. Travel and baggage delays are covered after 6 hours.
*   **Platinum:** This tier also covers hiking and public transport double indemnity (with higher limits than Gold). Crucially, it also offers the *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions with higher limits than the Gold add-on (e.g., S$200k medical overseas for adult <70). It features shorter delay thresholds (4 hours vs 6 hours for Gold/Basic) for travel and baggage delays, directly addressing the customer's inquiry about delay specifics. It also includes coverage for sports equipment loss/damage.

Given the customer's requirement for comprehensive coverage, the specific need for pre-existing condition cover (high blood pressure), and inquiries about double indemnity and delay thresholds, the Platinum tier provides the most robust fit. Although it requires the purchase of the pre-existing conditions add-on (like the Gold tier), Platinum offers higher coverage limits for both standard benefits and the pre-existing condition add-on benefits, and superior features like the shorter 4-hour delay trigger. While Gold (with the add-on) meets the minimum requirements, Platinum better aligns with the request for a comprehensive plan and addresses the specific points raised by the customer more effectively. Therefore, Platinum is recommended over Gold, despite the higher premium, as it offers a demonstrably higher level of coverage pertinent to the customer's needs. The No Mix-and-Match rule necessitates choosing the single tier that best covers all requirements.

    *   Includes Public Transport Double Indemnity with very high limits.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Requires purchase of an additional Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit to cover high blood pressure, which increases the premium.

    *   Specific details like the definition of 'close family member', detailed claim procedures, and specific exclusions (e.g., for electronics under baggage) require review of the full policy wording document.
