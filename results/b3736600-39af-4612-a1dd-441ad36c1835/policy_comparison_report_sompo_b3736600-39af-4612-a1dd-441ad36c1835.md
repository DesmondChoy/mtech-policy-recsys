**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) for the customer's trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes Emergency Medical Evacuation cover for pre-existing conditions (Section 4) and does not include the specific Amateur Sports Cover (Page 2 Highlights) needed for hiking.
*   **Deluxe:** Offers Emergency Medical Evacuation for pre-existing conditions (up to $100k, Section 4) and includes Amateur Sports Cover for hiking (trekking up to 3,500m, Page 2). It covers the basic requirements but has lower overseas medical limits ($300k) compared to GO Japan!.
*   **GO Japan!:** Specifically designed for travel to Japan, this tier offers higher overseas medical limits than Deluxe ($500k, Section 2) and includes the crucial Emergency Medical Evacuation for pre-existing conditions ($100k limit, Section 4). It also covers hiking via the Amateur Sports Cover (trekking up to 3,500m, Page 2). A key advantage is the inclusion of cashless medical services at numerous clinics/hospitals in Japan via the EAJ Hotline (Page 2), directly addressing a potential need in the destination country.
*   **Elite:** Provides the highest coverage limits across most categories, including $1M overseas medical and $150k for pre-existing condition evacuation (Section 2 & 4). It also covers hiking (Page 2). However, it is the most expensive tier and may exceed the customer's stated budget of "around $400".

**Conclusion:** The GO Japan! tier is recommended as the single most suitable option. It meets the critical requirements for Emergency Medical Evacuation cover related to pre-existing conditions (high blood pressure) and specific coverage for hiking. While Elite offers higher limits, GO Japan! provides robust coverage specifically tailored to the destination, including valuable cashless medical services, higher medical limits than Deluxe, and is likely to be closer to the customer's budget than Elite. It strikes the best balance between comprehensive coverage for the stated needs, destination-specific benefits, and probable cost-effectiveness. The No Mix-and-Match rule means selecting a single tier, and GO Japan! offers the most relevant package for this specific trip compared to Deluxe, without the potentially prohibitive cost of Elite. *Note:* Clarification on general medical expense coverage for pre-existing conditions (beyond evacuation), the definition of 'close family member', specific luggage claim procedures/exclusions, and double indemnity would require consulting the full policy wording, as these details are not fully specified in the provided JSON data for any tier.
