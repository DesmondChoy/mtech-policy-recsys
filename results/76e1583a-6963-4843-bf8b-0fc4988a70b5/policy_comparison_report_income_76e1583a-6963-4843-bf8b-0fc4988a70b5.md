**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All three tiers provide coverage for the customer's core requirements, including trip cancellation, emergency medical expenses, travel delays, lost/damaged luggage, and skiing activities (covered under 'Adventurous Activities'). The key differences lie in the coverage limits, with limits increasing from Classic to Deluxe to Preferred.

However, a critical requirement for the customer – coverage for additional pet accommodation costs in Singapore due to a delayed return flight – is **not explicitly mentioned or covered in any of the three tiers (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred)** based on the provided policy details. This represents a significant gap across all available options from this insurer.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. Since the critical pet cover requirement cannot be met by any tier, the decision focuses on the best fit for the *other* requirements. The Deluxe tier is recommended over the Classic tier because it offers substantially higher coverage limits for key areas like emergency medical expenses (SGD 500,000 vs SGD 250,000 for under 70s) and trip cancellation (SGD 10,000 vs SGD 5,000), providing significantly better protection for these common travel risks. While the Preferred tier offers even higher limits, the Deluxe tier provides a good balance and a significant upgrade from Classic, potentially aligning better with the customer's budget preference ("around $400") compared to the likely higher cost of Preferred, especially when a critical requirement remains unmet regardless of the tier chosen.

Therefore, the Deluxe tier is selected as the most suitable option, offering enhanced protection for the covered requirements compared to Classic, while acknowledging the unavoidable gap in coverage for pet accommodation costs across all INCOME tiers presented.

    *   Provides coverage for all core requirements (Trip Cancellation, Emergency Medical, Travel Delay, Luggage).
    *   Covers skiing under the Adventurous Activities benefit.
    *   Offers significantly higher coverage limits than the Classic tier for key benefits like Medical Expenses (SGD 500k pp under 70) and Trip Cancellation (SGD 10k pp).
    *   Includes Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for travellers under 70.
