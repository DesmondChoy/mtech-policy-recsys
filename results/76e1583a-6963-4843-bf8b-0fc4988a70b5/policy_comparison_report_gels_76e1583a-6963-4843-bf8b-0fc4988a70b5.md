**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** Fails to meet key requirements. It explicitly excludes coverage for 'Adventurous leisure activities' (Page 5, Section 37), which means skiing is not covered. It also lacks 'Pet care' coverage (Page 5, Section 30) for additional accommodation costs due to delays.
*   **Gold:** Meets all specified requirements. It covers 'Emergency medical expenses' (S$500k limit), 'Trip cancellation' (S$10k limit), 'Travel delays' (S$1.5k limit), 'Lost or damaged luggage' (S$5k limit). Crucially, it includes coverage for 'Adventurous leisure activities' (Page 5, Item 37), covering skiing, and 'Pet care' (Page 5, Item 30) for additional pet accommodation costs up to S$500.
*   **Platinum:** Also meets all requirements, offering higher limits (e.g., S$1M medical, S$15k cancellation, S$8k luggage) and slightly better terms (e.g., 4-hour travel delay trigger vs. 6 hours for Gold). It also adds 'Sports equipment cover' (Page 5, Section 33), which Gold lacks. However, Platinum is the most expensive tier and likely exceeds the customer's stated budget of "around $400".

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must select a single tier. Basic is unsuitable. While Platinum offers higher limits, the Gold tier provides sufficient coverage for all *stated* requirements, including the critical skiing and pet care needs, at a lower price point than Platinum, making it the most balanced and suitable choice, especially considering the budget constraint.

Therefore, the Gold tier is recommended as it is the lowest-priced tier from GELS that comprehensively covers all the customer's specific requirements, including skiing and pet accommodation costs, while offering substantial limits for core benefits.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Gold

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Covers all specific requirements including skiing (via Adventurous leisure activities) and pet accommodation costs (via Pet care).
    *   Provides substantial coverage limits for core benefits like medical (S$500k), cancellation (S$10k), and baggage (S$5k).
    *   Cheaper than the Platinum tier while still meeting all necessary coverage points.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Travel delay benefit triggers after 6 hours (Platinum triggers after 4 hours).
    *   Does not include specific 'Sports equipment cover' found in Platinum (though skiing itself is covered under adventurous activities).
    *   Price may still be slightly above the customer's ideal budget of "around $400", but it's the most cost-effective tier that meets all requirements.
