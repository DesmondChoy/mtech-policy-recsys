**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for Mrs. Lim's family trip:

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest coverage limits (e.g., $200k Overseas Medical, $7.5k Trip Cancellation, $3k Luggage with $300/item sub-limit). While it's the cheapest and offers the optional Pre-existing Conditions add-on, the medical limit under this add-on is only $50k, and the low luggage item limit is insufficient for a CPAP machine. Mobility aids are explicitly not covered under medical expenses.
*   **Business:** Provides a significant step up in coverage (e.g., $500k Overseas Medical, $10k Trip Cancellation, $5k Luggage with $500/item sub-limit). The Pre-existing Conditions add-on offers higher limits ($100k Medical, $100k Evacuation). The $500/item luggage limit better accommodates the CPAP machine, and mobility aids are covered up to $500 under medical expenses. This tier offers a good balance of comprehensive coverage for the family's needs, including the pre-existing condition and CPAP machine concerns.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Overseas Medical, $15k Trip Cancellation, $7.5k Luggage with $500/item sub-limit). The Pre-existing Conditions add-on limits are also highest ($150k Medical, $150k Evacuation). While providing the most comprehensive cover, it is the most expensive tier and likely exceeds the customer's preferred budget range of $200-$300, especially after adding the necessary Pre-existing Conditions cover for the husband.

The No Mix-and-Match rule means the family must choose one tier. The Business tier is recommended because it offers substantially better protection than Premium for the key requirements (higher medical limits, better pre-existing condition coverage limits, adequate luggage item limit for the CPAP machine, coverage for mobility aids) without the potentially prohibitive cost of the First tier. It represents the most suitable balance between comprehensive coverage addressing the family's specific concerns and likely cost, aligning better with the budget preference than the First tier. The optional 'Pre-existing medical conditions' cover MUST be purchased with the Business tier to cover claims related to the husband's high blood pressure.

### Requirement: Additional Requests (Budget $200-$300)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Not Applicable (Policy Feature/Constraint)
    *   **Base Limits:** Not Applicable
    *   **Conditional Limits:** Not Applicable
    *   **Source Specific Details:** Not Applicable
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: The Business tier is cheaper than the First tier but more expensive than the Premium tier. While the exact premium for this family (including the required Pre-existing Conditions add-on) is unknown without a specific quote, the Business tier offers a better balance of coverage and potential cost compared to the other tiers, making it the most likely to align with the budget preference while still meeting the essential coverage needs. However, it cannot be guaranteed to fall within the $200-$300 range without a quote.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Business

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides comprehensive medical coverage ($500k overseas limit per adult <70).
    *   Offers an optional add-on for Pre-existing Conditions with reasonable limits ($100k medical, $100k evacuation).
    *   Includes coverage for loss/damage to baggage with a $500 per item sub-limit, suitable for the CPAP machine.
    *   Covers mobility aids/medical equipment up to $500 under medical expenses.
    *   Covers trip cancellation ($10k limit) and travel delays ($500 overseas limit).
    *   Covers leisure sports like White Water Rafting under standard medical/accident benefits (assuming standard conditions met).
    *   Offers a better balance of coverage and likely cost compared to Premium and First tiers.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Requires the purchase of an additional 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on for coverage related to high blood pressure, which increases the total premium.
    *   Trip Cancellation/Cut Short/Disruption claims due to pre-existing conditions (with the add-on) are subject to a 50% co-payment.
    *   The final premium cost (including the add-on) is unknown and may potentially exceed the preferred $200-$300 budget.
    *   Coverage for White Water Rafting relies on it being considered a standard leisure activity and not falling under specific exclusions (which should be verified in the full policy wording).
