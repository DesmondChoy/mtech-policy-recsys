**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers for Mrs. Lim's family trip to Japan: All three tiers cover the core requirements of Trip Cancellation, Travel Delays, Medical Coverage, Lost/Damaged Luggage, and Sports/Adventure Activities (including White Water Rafting). However, they differ significantly in coverage limits and specific features.

*   **Classic:** Provides the most basic coverage limits (e.g., $250k Medical Overseas for adult <70, $500k Evacuation, $3k Luggage). While it covers rafting and is the cheapest, the medical and luggage limits might be insufficient given the family's concerns, especially regarding the CPAP machine (subject to a $500 per item limit).
*   **Deluxe:** Offers a substantial upgrade from Classic, with higher limits ($500k Medical Overseas adult <70, Unlimited Evacuation, $5k Luggage). This provides better peace of mind for medical needs and increases the valuables limit for luggage. It explicitly covers white water rafting under adventurous activities. The CPAP machine is still subject to the $500 per item limit under baggage, but the medical aids limit under medical expenses is higher ($1000).
*   **Preferred:** Provides the highest limits across the board (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas adult <70, Unlimited Evacuation, $8k Luggage). While offering the most comprehensive coverage, it is also the most expensive tier and likely exceeds the customer's stated budget of $200-$300.

**Crucially, all three tiers are standard plans and explicitly state (or are highly likely based on standard policy wording) that they *do not* cover pre-existing medical conditions like high blood pressure.** This is a significant gap that Mrs. Lim must be aware of, regardless of the chosen tier.

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the Deluxe tier represents the best balance. It significantly enhances medical and evacuation coverage compared to Classic, addressing the family's concerns more adequately, while likely being more budget-friendly than the Preferred tier. Although the pre-existing condition remains uncovered by the standard plan and the CPAP item limit is modest, Deluxe offers a more robust safety net than Classic within the standard options provided.

Therefore, the **Deluxe** tier is recommended as the most suitable option among the standard tiers presented, offering a good compromise between enhanced coverage levels and potential budget constraints, while acknowledging the critical limitation regarding pre-existing conditions.
