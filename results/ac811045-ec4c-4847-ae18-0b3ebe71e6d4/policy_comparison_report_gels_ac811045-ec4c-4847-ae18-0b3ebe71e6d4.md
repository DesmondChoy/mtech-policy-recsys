**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** Fails to meet critical requirements. It explicitly excludes coverage for 'Adventurous leisure activities' like White Water Rafting (Section 37) and does not offer any coverage (even via add-on) for pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure (Section 3, 5, 38).
*   **Gold:** Meets the core requirements. It covers 'Adventurous leisure activities' (Section 37), including White Water Rafting. Crucially, it offers an *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions (Section 38), which is essential for Mrs. Lim's husband's high blood pressure. Coverage limits for medical ($500k adult), cancellation ($10k pp), and luggage ($5k pp) are substantial.
*   **Platinum:** Offers the highest limits and slightly better features (e.g., shorter delay trigger). It also covers adventurous activities and offers the pre-existing condition add-on with higher limits than Gold. However, it is the most expensive tier and highly likely to exceed the customer's stated budget of $200-$300, especially when factoring in the pre-existing condition add-on premium.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. Basic is unsuitable. While Platinum offers the best coverage, it likely fails the budget constraint. The Gold tier provides a strong balance, covering all essential requirements including the specific activities and offering the necessary pre-existing condition coverage add-on, while being more budget-conscious than Platinum. It represents the most suitable holistic fit considering coverage needs and budget preference.

Therefore, the Gold tier is recommended as it covers white water rafting, provides the necessary option to cover pre-existing conditions via an add-on, offers robust limits for core benefits, and is more likely to align with the customer's budget compared to the Platinum tier.

### Requirement: Medical Needs (CPAP machine)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Baggage loss
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Person', 'limit': 5000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Maximum limit for family cover', 'limit': 10000, 'basis': None}]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null

It is not explicitly named or covered separately.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Gold

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Covers the specific requirement for White Water Rafting ('Adventurous leisure activities').
    *   Offers an optional add-on to cover the pre-existing condition (high blood pressure), which is a key concern.
    *   Provides robust coverage limits for essential benefits like Medical ($500k adult), Trip Cancellation ($10k pp), and Baggage ($5k pp).
    *   Includes useful benefits like Travel Delay, Baggage Delay, and Emergency Evacuation.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Pre-existing condition coverage requires an additional premium via the add-on and is subject to specific sub-limits and co-payments (e.g., 50% co-pay for trip cancellation/disruption, $100 co-pay for outpatient medical).
    *   Coverage for the CPAP machine falls under general baggage loss and is subject to standard baggage limits and potential per-item sub-limits; it is not specifically insured.
    *   The total cost including the pre-existing condition add-on might exceed the customer's preferred budget of $200-$300 (this should be confirmed during quoting).
