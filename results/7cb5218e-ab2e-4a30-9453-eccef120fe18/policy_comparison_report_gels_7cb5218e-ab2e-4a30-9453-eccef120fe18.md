**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** Fails to meet key requirements. It explicitly excludes coverage for 'Adventurous leisure activities' (Section 37), meaning skiing participation is not covered. It also lacks 'Sports equipment cover' (Section 33) and 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' (Section 19), leaving the specific wedding cancellation request unaddressed.
*   **Gold:** Meets several core requirements like Medical Expenses ($500k), Trip Cancellation ($10k), Travel Delay ($1.5k), and Baggage Loss ($5k). It covers 'Adventurous leisure activities' (Section 37), meaning skiing participation is covered. It also includes 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' (Section 19), which *might* partially address the wedding cancellation request (subject to terms like 50% payout and purchase timing). However, it explicitly does *not* cover 'Sports equipment cover' (Section 33), leaving owned or rented ski equipment uninsured against loss or damage.
*   **Platinum:** Offers the highest limits for core needs (Medical $1M, Cancellation $15k, Delay $2k, Baggage $8k) and a better travel delay trigger (4 hours vs 6 hours). Like Gold, it covers 'Adventurous leisure activities' (Section 37) for skiing participation. Crucially, it *also* includes 'Sports equipment cover' (Section 33, up to $1k), addressing potential loss/damage to ski gear, which is a key aspect of the customer's stated activity. Furthermore, it provides higher limits for 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' (Section 19), offering potentially better (though still partial and conditional) coverage for the specific wedding cancellation scenario compared to Gold.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. While Gold covers skiing participation, Platinum provides more comprehensive coverage by including sports equipment protection, which is highly relevant for a skiing trip. Platinum also offers superior limits and benefits across the board, including the 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit relevant to the wedding cancellation query. Therefore, the Platinum tier is recommended as the single best fit, providing the most complete coverage for the customer's specific requirements, particularly the skiing activity and equipment.

    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Person', 'limit': 15000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Maximum limit for family cover', 'limit': 40000, 'basis': None}]

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Standard cancellation is covered with high limits.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Platinum

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides comprehensive coverage for skiing, including both participation (Adventurous leisure activities) and equipment loss/damage (Sports equipment cover).
    *   Offers the highest coverage limits for core benefits like Medical Expenses, Trip Cancellation, Travel Delay, and Baggage Loss among the GELS tiers.
    *   Includes 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit with higher limits, potentially offering partial coverage for the specific wedding cancellation scenario (subject to terms).
    *   Features a shorter trigger time (4 hours) for Travel Delay benefits compared to lower tiers.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip Cancellation: Cancellation specifically for a sister's wedding is not guaranteed full coverage; it likely falls under the 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit, which typically has conditions like partial payout (e.g., 50%) and requires purchase within 30 days of booking.
    *   Skiing Coverage: The 'Sports equipment cover' limit is $1,000, which might be insufficient for very expensive ski equipment.
