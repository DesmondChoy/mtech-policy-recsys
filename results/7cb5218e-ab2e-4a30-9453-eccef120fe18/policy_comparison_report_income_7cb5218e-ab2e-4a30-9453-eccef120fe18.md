**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing INCOME's Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers for the customer's 10-day skiing trip to Japan: All three tiers cover the core requirements: Emergency Medical Expenses, Trip Cancellation (for standard covered reasons), Travel Delays, Lost/Damaged Luggage, and participation in Skiing (under Adventurous Activities).

However, the tiers differ significantly in coverage limits.
*   **Classic:** Provides the most basic limits (e.g., $250k Medical Overseas, $5k Cancellation, $3k Luggage, $500k Evacuation). While it covers skiing, these limits, especially medical and evacuation, might be insufficient given the potential costs associated with skiing accidents in Japan.
*   **Deluxe:** Offers a substantial increase in key areas compared to Classic (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage) and crucially provides **Unlimited** Emergency Medical Evacuation for adults under 70. This is a significant advantage for a trip involving adventurous activities like skiing.
*   **Preferred:** Provides the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage) and also includes Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation.

The customer requested "standard cover" but also mentioned a "flexible budget" and the need for skiing coverage. Given the inherent risks of skiing and the potential high cost of medical treatment and evacuation in Japan, the Classic tier's limits appear too low. The Deluxe tier offers a strong balance, providing significantly enhanced protection (especially the unlimited evacuation) over the Classic tier, aligning well with the activity risk. While the Preferred tier offers even higher limits, the Deluxe tier's coverage (including $500k medical and unlimited evacuation) is robust and represents a significant upgrade, likely sufficient for the customer's needs without potentially over-insuring.

Regarding the specific request for cancellation cover due to a sister's wedding, standard travel insurance policies typically cover cancellation only for specific unforeseen events like serious illness/death of the insured or a close relative. Choosing to attend a wedding is generally not a covered reason under any standard tier. Therefore, this specific request does not differentiate the tiers, as none are likely to cover it.

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. The Deluxe tier provides the most suitable holistic package, offering comprehensive coverage with significantly higher limits than Classic, particularly for medical and unlimited evacuation essential for a skiing trip, while remaining a balanced choice compared to the maximum coverage of the Preferred tier.

### Requirement: Trip Cancellation

*   **Policy Coverage:** Cancelling your trip

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: General trip cancellation for covered unforeseen reasons (like illness, death of relative) is covered up to $10,000 per person.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Deluxe

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides robust coverage for all core requirements (Medical, Cancellation, Delay, Luggage).
    *   Explicitly covers Skiing under Adventurous Activities.
    *   Offers significantly higher limits than the Classic tier, particularly for Medical Expenses ($500k vs $250k).
    *   Includes Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation (for under 70s), a crucial benefit for skiing overseas.
    *   Offers a good balance between comprehensive coverage and cost compared to the highest tier (Preferred).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip Cancellation: The specific reason of cancelling *for* a sister's wedding is unlikely to be covered, as it typically falls outside standard unforeseen circumstances defined in policies. General cancellation for covered reasons (illness, etc.) is included.
