**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) for the customer's 10-day trip to Japan with skiing:

1.  **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it does not appear to offer specific coverage for amateur sports like snow-skiing, which is a primary activity for the customer. (Vital Policy Details, Page 2 Highlights & Page 5 Section 28).
2.  **Deluxe:** This tier covers snow-skiing under its Amateur Sports Cover (Page 2). It meets the basic requirements for Medical ($300k Overseas), Cancellation ($6k), Travel Delay ($1k max), and Luggage ($5k).
3.  **GO Japan!:** This tier also covers snow-skiing (Page 2) and is specifically designed for Japan travel, offering higher Overseas Medical cover ($500k) than Deluxe and includes a cashless medical service network in Japan (Page 2). Cancellation ($6k), Travel Delay ($1k max), and Luggage ($5k) limits are similar to Deluxe.
4.  **Elite:** This tier provides the highest coverage limits across all key areas: Overseas Medical ($1M), Cancellation ($15k), Travel Delay ($2k max), and Luggage ($8k). It also explicitly covers snow-skiing under its Amateur Sports Cover (Page 2).

The customer requires coverage for skiing, which carries inherent risks, and has indicated a flexible budget. While GO Japan! offers good coverage and a destination-specific perk (cashless medical), the Elite tier provides significantly higher limits, particularly for Medical Expenses ($1M vs $500k) and Trip Cancellation ($15k vs $6k). Given the potential costs associated with skiing accidents and the flexible budget, the superior limits of the Elite tier offer the most comprehensive protection and peace of mind. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose one tier; Elite provides the best overall package for their stated needs and activities, despite GO Japan!'s specific Japan focus.

Therefore, the Elite tier is recommended as it provides the highest level of coverage for all stated requirements, including the higher-risk activity of skiing, aligning with the customer's flexible budget and need for robust protection. It's important to note that trip cancellation specifically for attending a sister's wedding is highly unlikely to be covered under the standard "Insured Events" definition in any tier, as this typically relates to unforeseen emergencies rather than personal scheduling choices.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides the highest coverage limits for key areas like Medical Expenses ($1M Overseas), Trip Cancellation ($15k), Travel Delay ($2k), and Baggage ($8k).
    *   Explicitly covers snow-skiing under the Amateur Sports Cover benefit, addressing a primary activity.
    *   Includes Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for travellers up to 70 years old.
    *   Offers comprehensive protection suitable for the potential risks associated with skiing and international travel.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip Cancellation: While the limit is high ($15k), the specific reason requested (cancelling to attend sister's wedding due to date clash) is highly unlikely to be covered as it typically wouldn't fall under the policy's definition of an unforeseen "Insured Event".
