**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for this customer's 10-day ski trip to Japan for two adults:

*   **Core Coverage:** All three tiers provide the essential coverages requested: Emergency Medical Expenses, standard Trip Cancellation, Travel Delays, and Lost/Damaged Luggage. The First tier consistently offers the highest benefit limits across these core areas (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas vs $500k Business vs $200k Premium; $15k Base Cancellation vs $10k Business vs $7.5k Premium; $7.5k Baggage vs $5k Business vs $3k Premium).
*   **Skiing Activity:** Leisure skiing is covered under the standard Personal Accident and Medical Expense benefits in all tiers. However, coverage for owned ski *equipment* requires the optional "Sports equipment protector" add-on, which is available for all tiers with the same $2,000 limit and the same significant exclusion (damage that happens while the equipment is in use). Therefore, ski equipment coverage does not differentiate the tiers.
*   **Trip Cancellation (Sister's Wedding):** This specific reason is not covered under standard Trip Cancellation clauses in any tier. It requires the "Cancel for any reason" (CFAR) optional add-on. This add-on reimburses 50% of non-refundable costs up to a certain limit, which varies by tier: Premium ($1,000), Business ($3,000), and First ($6,000). Given the potential cost of a 10-day trip for two to Japan, the $1,000 limit under Premium is likely insufficient to meaningfully address this specific requirement. The $3,000 limit under Business is better, but the $6,000 limit under the First tier provides the most substantial coverage for this non-standard cancellation reason.
*   **No Mix-and-Match:** The customer must select a single tier.

Considering the customer has a flexible budget ("Budget is flexible") and specifically highlighted the need for cancellation cover related to the sister's wedding, the First tier is the most suitable. Although the CFAR add-on only provides 50% reimbursement, the First tier offers the highest limit ($6,000) for this specific scenario, alongside the highest overall limits for core medical, cancellation, delay, and baggage protection. While Business offers a reasonable middle ground, First provides the most comprehensive protection aligned with the customer's stated needs and flexibility on cost.

### Requirement: Trip Cancellation

*   **Policy Coverage:** Trip cancellation and loss of deposit

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: The activity of leisure skiing is covered under Personal Accident, Medical Expenses, and likely Personal Liability. However, owned ski equipment is excluded from standard baggage cover and requires the purchase of the optional 'Sports equipment protector' add-on. This add-on has a limit of $2,000 and, crucially, excludes coverage for damage that occurs *while the equipment is in use* (e.g., during skiing).

## Summary for Recommended Tier: First

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Highest available limits for core coverage: Emergency Medical Expenses ($1M overseas), standard Trip Cancellation ($15k), Travel Delay ($1k overseas), and Baggage ($7.5k).
    *   Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation.
    *   Highest available limit ($6,000) for the optional 'Cancel for any reason' cover, providing the best available option (albeit 50% reimbursement) for the specific wedding cancellation scenario.
    *   Covers the activity of leisure skiing under standard Medical and Personal Accident benefits.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip Cancellation (Sister's Wedding): This specific reason is only covered via the optional 'Cancel for any reason' add-on, which provides only 50% reimbursement (up to $6,000) and must be purchased within 7 days of the initial trip deposit.
    *   Skiing Coverage (Equipment): Owned ski equipment requires purchasing the optional 'Sports equipment protector' add-on. This add-on has a $2,000 limit and excludes damage that occurs while the equipment is actively being used for skiing.
    *   This is the most expensive tier offered by FWD.
