**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a 10-day trip to Thailand:

1.  **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for travel to Japan and includes features like cashless medical services within Japan. As the customer is travelling to Thailand, this tier is unsuitable.
2.  **Vital:** This is the most basic tier. While it covers core requirements like medical expenses, luggage loss, travel delays, and trip cancellation, it explicitly *excludes* coverage for "Leisure Underwater Activities" (Section 28 N.A.) and does not list specific amateur sports cover. Since the customer requires cover for scuba diving, the Vital tier is unsuitable.
3.  **Deluxe vs. Elite:** Both Deluxe and Elite cover all the core requirements (medical, luggage, delays, cancellation) and specifically include cover for "Leisure Underwater Activities" (Section 28) and "Amateur Sports" (Page 2), which would cover scuba diving. Elite offers significantly higher coverage limits across most categories (e.g., $1M vs $300k for Overseas Medical, $15k vs $6k for Trip Cancellation, $8k vs $5k for Baggage). However, the customer did not specify a need for exceptionally high limits, requesting "standard stuff" alongside specific coverage types. Both Deluxe and Elite fulfil the *types* of coverage requested, including the crucial scuba diving cover.
4.  **Tie-Breaking Rule:** Since both Deluxe and Elite meet the specified requirements (including the activity cover), they are considered suitable. The Tie-Breaking Rule states that the cheapest suitable option should be selected. Based on the provided price ranking (Vital < Deluxe < GO Japan! < Elite), Deluxe is cheaper than Elite.
5.  **Cancellation Clarification:** Regarding the request for clarification on cancellation due to a family event like a wedding date change, standard trip cancellation coverage (Section 13 in both Deluxe and Elite) reimburses non-refundable costs only if the cancellation is due to specific, unforeseen "Insured Events" listed in the policy wording (typically serious illness/injury/death of insured or close relative, strike, natural disaster affecting destination, etc.). A change in a wedding date is generally considered a change in personal plans and is *not* typically listed as a covered Insured Event under standard policies like Deluxe. This clarification applies similarly to both Deluxe and Elite.

Therefore, the **Deluxe** tier is recommended. It meets all the customer's specified coverage requirements, including the essential scuba diving cover, at a lower price point than the Elite tier, making it the most suitable choice according to the selection rules. The customer should be advised that cancellation due to the specified family event (wedding date change) is unlikely to be covered.
