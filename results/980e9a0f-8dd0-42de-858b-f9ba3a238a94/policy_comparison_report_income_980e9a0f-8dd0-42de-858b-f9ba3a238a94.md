**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All three tiers cover the customer's core requirements, including emergency medical expenses, lost/damaged luggage, travel delays (payable after 6 hours), trip cancellation due to illness (covered under 'unforeseen circumstances'), and coverage for scuba diving under 'Adventurous Activities' (subject to conditions like PADI certification or instructor supervision, and depth limits).

The primary differences lie in the coverage limits.
*   **Medical Expenses Overseas (under 70):** Classic ($250k), Deluxe ($500k), Preferred ($1M).
*   **Trip Cancellation:** Classic ($5k), Deluxe ($10k), Preferred ($15k).
*   **Lost/Damaged Luggage:** Classic ($3k), Deluxe ($5k), Preferred ($8k).
*   **Travel Delay (Max):** Classic ($1k), Deluxe ($1.5k), Preferred ($2k).

While the customer requested "standard stuff," they also highlighted concerns about "significant" delays and are participating in scuba diving, an activity with inherent risks where higher medical coverage is prudent. The Classic tier offers the lowest limits, which might be insufficient for a serious medical event overseas or significant cancellation costs. The Preferred tier offers the highest limits but may be more than necessary given the "standard" requirement and will be the most expensive.

The Deluxe tier provides a significant increase in coverage limits compared to Classic, offering a much better safety net (e.g., double the medical and cancellation limits), which aligns well with international travel involving adventurous activities. It strikes the best balance between providing robust "standard" coverage and addressing the customer's specific activities and concerns without potentially over-insuring like the Preferred tier.

Regarding the specific request for clarification on cancellation due to a family event (wedding date change): None of the policy snippets explicitly state that a change in a family event like a wedding date is a covered reason for cancellation under "unforeseen circumstances." Standard policies typically cover cancellations due to specific, unavoidable events like serious illness/death of close family, natural disasters, etc., not voluntary changes to social plans. This clarification points to a likely coverage gap across *all* tiers for this specific scenario.

Therefore, considering the No Mix-and-Match rule and the need for balanced coverage including scuba diving, the **Deluxe** tier is recommended as the most suitable holistic option.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Covers cancellation due to illness (as an unforeseen circumstance), but the specific scenario of cancellation due to a family event (wedding date change) is not explicitly listed as covered and is unlikely to meet the standard definition of an unforeseen, unavoidable event required for a claim.

*   **Policy Coverage:** Adventurous activities
    *   **Base Limits:** []
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null

Trekking must be below 4,000m, in public areas or organised/guided.', 'source_location': 'Page 10, Note 2, Note 6, Note 7'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met

### Requirement: additional_requests: Need clarification on cancellation cover due to family events.

*   **Policy Coverage:** Cancelling your trip
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per insured person', 'limit': 10000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Family total', 'limit': 30000, 'basis': None}]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Not Met: The policy covers cancellation due to specified "unforeseen circumstances," which typically include events like serious illness/death of the insured, travel companion, or close relative. Based on standard travel insurance definitions and the provided snippets, a voluntary change of a wedding date by a family member (sister) is highly unlikely to be considered a covered reason for cancellation. This clarification indicates the specific scenario requested is not covered.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Deluxe

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides robust coverage for all core requirements: emergency medical ($500k limit, unlimited evacuation for under 70s), lost/damaged luggage ($5k limit), travel delay ($1.5k max), and trip cancellation due to illness ($10k limit).
    *   Explicitly covers scuba diving under Adventurous Activities (subject to conditions).
    *   Offers significantly higher limits than the Classic tier, providing a better safety net, especially important given international travel and scuba diving.
    *   Includes COVID-19 cover for relevant sections (subject to conditions).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip Cancellation: While covered for illness, the specific scenario requested (cancellation due to sister's wedding date change) is not explicitly covered and unlikely to meet the policy definition of a covered unforeseen circumstance.
    *   Pre-existing conditions are not covered under this standard plan. (Note: Customer stated no pre-existing conditions, so this is informational).
