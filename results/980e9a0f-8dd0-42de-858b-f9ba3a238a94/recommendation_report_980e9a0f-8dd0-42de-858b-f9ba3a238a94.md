# Travel Insurance Recommendation for Customer 980e9a0f-8dd0-42de-858b-f9ba3a238a94

---

## Final Recommendation
Based on a detailed analysis of your requirements against available policies, the recommended policy is:

**GELS - Platinum**

### Justification
The customer explicitly prioritized trip cancellation flexibility, calling it 'the main thing' and specifically asking about cover for cancelling due to a family event like a sister's wedding date changing ('specifically', 'It's important', 'Need to know'). This indicates a high priority for understanding and potentially having coverage for non-standard cancellation reasons. Scuba diving cover was also explicitly requested ('make sure that's covered'), making it another key requirement. While medical, luggage, and delay cover were mentioned as necessary ('standard', 'obviously'), they received less emphasis.

Comparing the finalists:
1.  **GELS Platinum:** Fully meets all core requirements (Medical, Luggage, Delay, standard Cancellation) with the highest limits ($1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $8k Baggage). Crucially, it explicitly covers scuba diving (Section 37) and includes 'Sports equipment cover' (Section 33). Most importantly, it directly addresses the customer's primary concern via the *included* 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit (Section 19). This provides clarification and potential partial coverage (up to $6k limit, likely 50% payout) for cancellation due to *any* reason, including the specified family event, provided the policy is bought within 30 days of the initial booking. It also has the best travel delay trigger (4 hours, Section 21).
2.  **FWD Business:** Meets core requirements with good limits ($500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $5k Baggage) and covers scuba diving. However, it only addresses the prioritized cancellation scenario via an *optional, extra-cost* 'Cancel for any reason' add-on (Page 9, 27). This add-on has a lower limit ($3k, 50% payout) and a stricter purchase window (within 7 days of deposit) compared to the GELS benefit. While an option, it's less comprehensive and requires an additional purchase decision.
3.  **SOMPO Deluxe:** Meets core requirements and covers scuba diving (Section 28), but with lower limits ($300k Medical, $6k Cancellation, $5k Baggage). Critically, it *fails* to address the customer's prioritized cancellation clarification; its standard cancellation (Section 13) does not cover the family event scenario, and no 'cancel for any reason' type benefit is mentioned in the report (explicitly assessed as 'Not Met').

**Conclusion:** GELS Platinum is the single best recommendation. Although likely the most expensive option, it provides the most comprehensive coverage overall and, critically, offers the best solution for the customer's *most emphasized requirement* – cancellation flexibility for non-standard reasons – through an *included* benefit (Section 19) with a higher limit and more flexible purchase condition than the optional FWD add-on. SOMPO Deluxe is unsuitable as it fails to address this key prioritized need.
