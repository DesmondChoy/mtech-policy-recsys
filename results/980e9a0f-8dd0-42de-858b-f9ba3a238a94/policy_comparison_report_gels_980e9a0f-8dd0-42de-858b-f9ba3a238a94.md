**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** Fails to meet key requirements. It explicitly excludes coverage for 'Adventurous leisure activities' like scuba diving (Section 37) and does not offer 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' cover (Section 19), meaning it cannot address the customer's need for clarification on cancellation due to family events like a wedding date change. While it covers core medical, luggage, delay, and standard cancellation, the lack of scuba cover makes it unsuitable.
*   **Gold:** Meets the core requirements, including 'Adventurous leisure activities' cover for scuba diving (Section 37). It also includes 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' (Section 19), providing a mechanism (albeit with 50% payout and purchase timing conditions) to address the family event cancellation query. Coverage limits are substantial (e.g., $500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $5k Baggage). The travel delay trigger is 6 hours.
*   **Platinum:** Also meets all core requirements, including scuba diving cover (Section 37) and 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' (Section 19) with a higher limit ($6k vs $3k for cancellation) than Gold, addressing the family event query similarly. Crucially, Platinum offers significantly higher overall limits (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $8k Baggage), a shorter travel delay trigger (4 hours vs 6 hours, Section 21), and adds 'Sports equipment cover' (Section 33) up to $1000, which is relevant for scuba diving gear.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. Basic is eliminated. While Gold meets the minimum requirements, Platinum provides demonstrably superior coverage directly relevant to the customer's needs: higher limits across the board, a more favourable travel delay trigger (4 hours), and specific sports equipment cover potentially applicable to scuba gear. This makes Platinum the *most suitable* tier, offering the best overall fit and comprehensive protection for the stated requirements and activities.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met: The clarification is provided. Standard 'Trip Cancellation' (Section 16) covers specific unforeseen events (like illness, death of family member etc. - exact list in full policy wording), which typically *does not* include a change of mind or change of plans like a wedding date moving. However, the 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit (Section 19) *does* provide cover (up to $6000, likely 50% payout of non-refundable costs) for cancellation due to *any* reason, including a family event like a wedding date change, provided the policy is purchased within 30 days of the initial travel booking. This directly addresses the customer's need for clarification.
