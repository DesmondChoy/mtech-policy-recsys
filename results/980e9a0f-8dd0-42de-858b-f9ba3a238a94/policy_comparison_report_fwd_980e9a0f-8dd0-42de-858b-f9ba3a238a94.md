**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers cover the customer's core requirements for emergency medical expenses, lost/damaged luggage, travel delays, trip cancellation due to illness, and leisure scuba diving (as it's not typically excluded under standard hazardous activity exclusions for leisure diving).

However, the tiers differ significantly in coverage limits:
*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Medical, $7.5k Cancellation, $3k Luggage, $300 Delay).
*   **Business:** Provides substantially higher limits (e.g., $500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage, $500 Delay).
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $7.5k Luggage, $1k Delay).

Regarding the specific request for cancellation due to a family event (wedding date change):
*   Standard 'Trip Cancellation' across all tiers **does not** cover this reason, as it typically requires unforeseen events like serious illness/death of a close family member.
*   All tiers offer an optional 'Cancel for any reason' (CFAR) add-on. This *could* provide partial coverage (50% reimbursement up to a limit) for such an event, but it must be purchased within 7 days of the initial trip deposit and carries an additional premium. The CFAR limits are: Premium ($1k), Business ($3k), First ($6k).

Considering the customer wants "standard stuff" but also mentioned specific concerns (significant delays, cancellation, diving) for a 10-day trip to Thailand, the **Business** tier strikes the best balance. It offers robust, mid-range coverage that significantly exceeds the Premium tier's limits, providing better protection for medical emergencies, luggage loss, and standard cancellation reasons. While First offers higher limits, they may be more than necessary for this trip profile, potentially leading to unnecessary cost. The Business tier's CFAR add-on limit ($3k) also offers a more meaningful potential reimbursement than Premium's ($1k) if the customer opts for it to address the family event concern.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must select a single tier. The Business tier provides a comprehensive and well-balanced package that addresses all stated requirements adequately without the potentially lower limits of Premium or the higher cost/limits of First.

    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Pays if trip cancelled within 30 days before departure due to specified events (e.g., serious injury/illness/death of insured/companion/family, witness duty, home damage, serious public event, onward flight cancellation by airline due to specific reasons, hijack >12hrs).

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Standard cancellation covers illness but does not cover cancellation due to a family event like a wedding date change. The optional 'Cancel for any reason' add-on can provide partial (50%) coverage for this specific scenario, up to $3,000, but requires purchasing the add-on within 7 days of the initial trip deposit and paying an additional premium.

### Requirement: scuba diving

*   **Policy Coverage:** Personal accident
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Adult below 70 years of age', 'limit': 300000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Adult 70 years old or older', 'limit': 60000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Child covered under a family plan', 'limit': 90000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Overall limit for family plan', 'limit': 750000, 'basis': None}]

Exclusions apply (e.g., specific dental, Chinese med, planned treatment).", 'source_location': 'Page 24 & 26'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met: Leisure scuba diving is typically covered under standard travel insurance policies like FWD's, provided it's not professional, competitive, or exceeding standard depth limits (often around 30-40m, though not specified in the extract). The policy doesn't list leisure scuba diving as a specific exclusion in the provided details. Coverage would fall under Personal Accident and Medical Expenses if an incident occurred during the activity.

    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Optional add-on providing 50% reimbursement (up to limits) for Trip Cancellation, Postponement, or Cut Short for reasons not covered under the standard policy sections.', 'source_location': 'Page 27'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Condition: Must purchase this cover within 7 days from making the initial trip deposit.', 'source_location': 'Page 27'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Condition for Trip Cut Short: Trip must have commenced for 48 hours or more.', 'source_location': 'Page 27'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Exclusions: Refunded amounts, upgrades, extra costs not in original itinerary (for cut short). Policy ends if cancellation/postponement paid.', 'source_location': 'Page 27-28'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met: The policy details allow for clarification. Standard cancellation does *not* cover a wedding date change. The optional 'Cancel for any reason' add-on *does* provide a mechanism for partial coverage (50% reimbursement up to $3,000) for such non-standard reasons, provided the add-on is purchased under the specified conditions (within 7 days of initial deposit).

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Business

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides robust, well-balanced coverage across all core requirements (Medical $500k, Cancellation $10k, Luggage $5k, Delay $500).
    *   Unlimited emergency medical evacuation.

*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip Cancellation: Standard coverage does not include cancellation due to voluntary family event changes like a wedding date shift.
