**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a trip to Australia:

1.  **GO Japan!:** This tier is immediately unsuitable as it is specifically designed for travel to Japan, while the customer's destination is Australia.
2.  **Vital:** This tier fails to meet critical requirements. It explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation (Section 4) and likely under general medical expenses based on standard exclusions (Page 7 Declaration). Furthermore, it lacks the specific "Amateur Sports Cover" mentioned in other tiers, making coverage for White Water Rafting highly unlikely. Its coverage limits are also the lowest.
3.  **Deluxe vs. Elite:** Both tiers offer improvements over Vital. They include "Amateur Sports Cover" (though neither explicitly lists White Water Rafting) and provide coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation (Section 4, Elite limit $150k vs Deluxe $100k). However, for both tiers, the provided JSON data for general Medical Expenses Overseas (Section 2) does not explicitly confirm coverage for pre-existing conditions beyond evacuation/repatriation, leaving a potential gap against the requirement for "Full medical coverage including pre-existing conditions." A significant issue common to *all* tiers is the Trip Cancellation requirement: cancelling to attend a sister's wedding, even if the date is finalized later, is highly unlikely to be considered a covered "Insured Event" under standard policy terms which typically require unforeseen circumstances (e.g., illness, death). The customer's demand for a "guarantee" on this point cannot be met by these standard policies.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose the single best overall fit. While neither Deluxe nor Elite perfectly meets *all* requirements (specifically the wedding cancellation and explicit White Water Rafting cover), Elite offers the highest available limits across key areas: Medical Expenses Overseas ($1M vs $300k), Trip Cancellation ($15k vs $6k), Baggage Loss ($8k vs $5k), and Travel Delay ($2k vs $1k). It also has a higher limit for pre-existing condition coverage under Emergency Evacuation/Repatriation ($150k vs $100k).

Therefore, the **Elite** tier is recommended as it provides the most comprehensive coverage and highest financial protection available within the SOMPO options for the aspects it *does* cover, particularly the high medical limits and the inclusion of pre-existing condition cover for evacuation/repatriation. Although significant gaps remain regarding the specific cancellation reason and explicit White Water Rafting cover, Elite represents the best available option among the provided tiers.

## Detailed Coverage Analysis for Recommended Tier: Elite

### Requirement: Medical Coverage (including pre-existing condition High blood pressure)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Medical Expenses Incurred Overseas
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person - 70 years & below', 'limit': 1000000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - Over 70 years', 'limit': 100000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 1200000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Physiotherapist, Chinese Physician or Chiropractor', 'limit': 300, 'basis': '$50 per visit'}, {'type': 'Dentist', 'limit': 500, 'basis': None}]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Covers outpatient and hospitalisation medical expenses incurred overseas arising from accident or sickness, emergency dental expenses arising from accident, and accidental miscarriage. Includes treatment by specified practitioners.', 'source_location': 'Page 3, Section 2'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Overseas coverage up to $1,000,000, including Chinese Physicians and Chiropractors.', 'source_location': 'Page 2, Overseas Medical Expenses Highlight'}]
*   **Policy Coverage:** Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation (Including Mortal Remains) Back to Singapore
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person - up to 70 years', 'limit': 'Unlimited', 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - above 70 years', 'limit': 150000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - up to 70 years (Pre-existing Conditions)', 'limit': 150000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - above 70 years (Pre-existing Conditions)', 'limit': 75000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 'No aggregate limit', 'basis': None}]

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: While Emergency Evacuation/Repatriation explicitly covers pre-existing conditions up to $150k, the policy details provided for general 'Medical Expenses Incurred Overseas' (Section 2) do not explicitly state coverage for pre-existing conditions, creating uncertainty about whether *all* medical treatment for the high blood pressure would be covered beyond emergency evacuation.

### Requirement: Lost, Damaged, or Delayed Luggage Coverage

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Not Met: While the Elite tier includes "Amateur Sports Cover", White Water Rafting is not explicitly listed among the covered activities (tandem air sports, snow-skiing, hot-air ballooning, bungee jumping, indoor rock climbing, trekking). Standard policies often exclude activities like white water rafting unless specifically mentioned or if certain conditions (e.g., grade of rapids, professional guide) are met, which are not detailed here.

### Requirement: Travel Delay Coverage

*   **Policy Coverage:** Travel Delay
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person', 'limit': 65, 'basis': '$100 for 1st full 6 hours (overseas or in S\'pore), $65 per 4 hours thereafter (overseas)'}, {'type': 'Maximum Limit', 'limit': 2000, 'basis': None}]

### Requirement: Trip Cancellation Coverage (specifically due to attending sister's wedding)

    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person', 'limit': 15000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 25000, 'basis': None}]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Covers loss of irrecoverable travel deposits or charges paid in advance due to necessary cancellation or postponement of the entire trip arising from Insured Events occurring within 30 days before departure.', 'source_location': 'Page 4, Section 13'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Includes coverage for loss of frequent flyer or similar travel points used to purchase an airline ticket.', 'source_location': 'Page 2, Trip Cancellation or Postponement Highlight'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Not Met: Standard travel insurance policies cover trip cancellation only for specific, unforeseen "Insured Events" (typically serious illness/death of traveler or close relative, strike, natural disaster, etc.). Cancelling a trip because a family event like a wedding is scheduled during the travel dates, even if the exact date was initially uncertain, is highly unlikely to be listed as a covered Insured Event. The customer's demand for a "guarantee" for this specific reason cannot be met by this standard policy.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Highest available coverage limits for Medical Expenses Overseas ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k for covered reasons), Baggage Loss ($8k), and Travel Delay ($2k).
    *   Explicitly covers pre-existing medical conditions for Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation up to a high limit ($150k for under 70s).
    *   Includes coverage for some Amateur Sports (though not the specific one requested).
    *   Provides high limits for Baggage Delay ($1k max).
    *   Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for travelers under 70 (for non-pre-existing conditions).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Medical Coverage: Uncertainty whether general Medical Expenses Overseas (Section 2) cover pre-existing conditions beyond the specific coverage under Emergency Evacuation/Repatriation (Section 4).
    *   Adventure Activities Coverage: White Water Rafting is not explicitly listed as a covered activity under the Amateur Sports Cover.
    *   Trip Cancellation Coverage: The specific reason requested (attending sister's wedding) is almost certainly not a covered "Insured Event" under the policy terms.
