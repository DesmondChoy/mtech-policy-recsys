## Final Recommendation
Based on a detailed analysis of your requirements against available policies, the recommended policy is:

**GELS - Platinum**

### Justification
Based on the detailed comparison reports, GELS Platinum emerges as the single best overall policy for the customer, despite some unavoidable gaps shared with the other finalist, FWD First.

**Comparison against FWD First:**

1.  **Pre-existing Condition Coverage:** Both policies require an optional add-on. GELS Platinum offers a higher medical expense limit ($200,000) under its add-on compared to FWD First ($150,000) (Source: GELS Report, Page 5, Section 38a vs FWD Report, Page 9, Optional Covers). While GELS includes a S$100 co-payment per outpatient visit for pre-existing conditions (Source: GELS Report, Page 5, Footnote #), the higher overall limit provides greater protection against significant medical events related to the customer's high blood pressure, aligning better with the desire for comprehensive coverage.

2.  **Delay Benefits:** GELS Platinum offers superior delay coverage. Both Travel Delay and Baggage Delay benefits trigger after only 4 hours, compared to 6 hours for FWD First (Source: GELS Report, Page 4, Sections 21 & 25 vs FWD Report, Page 13 & 14). Furthermore, GELS Platinum provides higher maximum limits for Travel Delay ($2,000 vs $1,000) and Baggage Delay ($1,200 vs $900) (Source: GELS Report, Page 4 vs FWD Report, Page 12 & 14).

3.  **Trip Cancellation (Wedding):** Neither policy can meet the customer's demand for 'guaranteed full reimbursement' for cancelling due to a sister's wedding. However, both offer a potential partial reimbursement via an 'any reason' type benefit, capped at $6,000 (likely 50% reimbursement). GELS Platinum's 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit requires the policy to be purchased within 30 days of the initial travel booking (Source: GELS Report, Page 4, Section 19 & Page 2 Footnote *), offering a more flexible window compared to FWD First's 'Cancel for any reason' add-on, which must be purchased within 7 days of the initial trip deposit (Source: FWD Report, Page 27).

4.  **Luggage Loss/Damage:** GELS Platinum offers a slightly higher overall limit ($8,000) compared to FWD First ($7,500) (Source: GELS Report, Page 4, Section 22 vs FWD Report, Page 14).

5.  **Adventure Activities:** Both policies adequately cover White Water Rafting as a leisure activity.

**Comparison against INCOME Preferred:**

INCOME Preferred is unsuitable primarily because its standard policy terms (as inferred from the report and typical product structure) do not cover pre-existing medical conditions, failing a critical customer requirement. Furthermore, it lacks any 'Cancel for any reason' type benefit, offering no potential coverage for the non-standard wedding cancellation reason. While it has high limits in some areas, the failure to meet these two key requirements disqualifies it.

**Conclusion:**

GELS Platinum provides the most comprehensive coverage aligned with the customer's needs among the finalists. It offers higher limits for the crucial pre-existing condition add-on (albeit with a co-pay), significantly better delay benefits (faster triggers, higher limits), slightly better luggage limits, and a more flexible condition for the partial 'any reason' cancellation coverage compared to FWD First. While the 'guaranteed full reimbursement' for the wedding cancellation remains unmet by any policy, GELS Platinum offers the best available package overall.
