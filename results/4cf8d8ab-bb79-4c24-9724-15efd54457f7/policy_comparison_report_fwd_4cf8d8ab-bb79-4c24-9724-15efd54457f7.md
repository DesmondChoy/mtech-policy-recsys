**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers require an optional add-on for pre-existing medical conditions, with First offering the highest medical ($150k) and evacuation ($150k) limits under this add-on, best addressing the customer's high blood pressure concern. For luggage, First provides the highest overall limits ($7.5k) and delay benefit ($900). Similarly, First offers the highest travel delay benefit ($1k). Critically, none of the tiers' standard trip cancellation policies cover cancellation due to attending a wedding. The only potential coverage comes from the optional 'Cancel for any reason' (CFAR) add-on, which reimburses 50% of costs up to a tier-specific limit. First offers the highest CFAR limit ($6k), providing the maximum possible (though still partial) reimbursement for this non-negotiable requirement. Premium and Business offer significantly lower limits for both the pre-existing condition add-on and the CFAR add-on.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must select a single tier. While no tier can fully guarantee reimbursement for wedding cancellation as demanded, the First tier provides the highest available limits for the key requirements (Medical with pre-existing condition add-on, Luggage, Travel Delay) and the highest potential reimbursement for the specific cancellation reason via the CFAR add-on. Considering the customer's emphasis on comprehensive coverage, flexible budget, and the specific needs outlined, the First tier is the most suitable option among the FWD offerings.

## Detailed Coverage Analysis for Recommended Tier: First

### Requirement: Medical Coverage (including pre-existing High Blood Pressure)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Medical expenses incurred overseas
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Adult below 70 years of age', 'limit': 1000000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Adult 70 years old or older', 'limit': 200000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Child covered under a family plan', 'limit': 300000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Overall limit for family plan', 'limit': 2500000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Sub-limit for mobility aids', 'limit': 1000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Sub-limit for dental expenses caused by accident', 'limit': 5000, 'basis': None}]

Limit applies.", 'source_location': 'Page 24, Emergency medical evacuation & repatriation'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Excludes claims arising from pre-existing conditions unless the optional cover is purchased and applies.', 'source_location': 'Page 31, General Exclusions'}]

    *   **Base Limits:** []

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Requires purchase of the optional 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on, as standard cover excludes this. The First tier offers the highest limits ($150k Medical, $150k Evacuation) for this add-on compared to other tiers, but it's still subject to limits and specific exclusions.

### Requirement: Lost, Damaged, or Delayed Luggage Coverage

*   **Policy Coverage:** Theft of or damage to baggage or personal belongings
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Overall limit', 'limit': 7500, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Sub-limit for laptop / tablet (in total)', 'limit': 1000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Sub-limit for mobile phone (in total)', 'limit': 500, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Sub-limit for jewellery (in total)', 'limit': 500, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Sub-limit for all other items (per item)', 'limit': 500, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Overall limit for family plan', 'limit': 18750, 'basis': None}]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Payable if baggage or personal belongings are stolen or accidentally damaged during the trip, or lost while in the custody of an airline operator.', 'source_location': 'Page 14, Theft of or damage to baggage or personal belongings'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Payment based on depreciation or market value.

All capped at benefit limits. Without proof: Current market value up to S$50/item, max 5 items.', 'source_location': 'Page 15, How much we pay'}, {'detail_snippet': "High-value items (phones, laptops, tablets, jewellery) must be carried by you, not checked-in or left unattended in vehicle. Items must be under your care or authorised person's care. Police report required within 24 hours for theft. Benefit reduced by any Baggage Delay payment for the same items.", 'source_location': 'Page 15, What you should know'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Excludes perishables, consumables, vehicles, loaded cards, wear & tear, musical instruments, unauthorised phone costs, items not yours, sports equipment, business goods, stored information, unexplained loss/mysterious disappearance.', 'source_location': 'Page 15, What is not covered'}]
*   **Policy Coverage:** Baggage delay
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Person (Overseas Delay)', 'limit': 900, 'basis': 'S$150 for every six hours of delay'}, {'type': 'Per Person (Singapore Delay)', 'limit': 150, 'basis': 'S$150 for first six hour delay in Singapore only'}]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Payable if checked-in baggage is delayed, misdirected, or temporarily misplaced by public transport provider and reaches 6 continuous hours or more after arrival at scheduled destination (including return to Singapore).', 'source_location': 'Page 14, Baggage delay'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Benefit paid for each 6-hour period baggage is delayed (except only first 6 hours paid for delay in Singapore). Requires written proof from provider/agent stating name, date, time, duration, reason. Paid per claim, not per bag. Only one person paid if sharing bag.', 'source_location': 'Page 14, What we pay & What you should know'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: The policy covers lost, damaged, and delayed luggage with the highest limits among the tiers. However, the customer's expectation of "immediate reimbursement" for loss/damage is not met (claims process and depreciation apply), and the delay benefit provides a fixed cash sum after 6 hours, not necessarily "money for essentials right away".

### Requirement: Adventure Activities Coverage (White Water Rafting)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Medical expenses incurred overseas
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Adult below 70 years of age', 'limit': 1000000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Adult 70 years old or older', 'limit': 200000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Child covered under a family plan', 'limit': 300000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Overall limit for family plan', 'limit': 2500000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Sub-limit for mobility aids', 'limit': 1000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Sub-limit for dental expenses caused by accident', 'limit': 5000, 'basis': None}]

    *   **Source Specific Details:** [See details under Medical Coverage requirement above]
*   **Policy Coverage:** Personal accident
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Adult below 70 years of age', 'limit': 400000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Adult 70 years old or older', 'limit': 80000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Child covered under a family plan', 'limit': 120000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Overall limit for family plan', 'limit': 1000000, 'basis': None}]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Pays a lump sum if you suffer an accident during the trip that causes death or total and permanent disability (TPD) within 90 days.', 'source_location': 'Page 18, Personal accident'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Benefit paid according to scale: Accidental death (100%), TPD (100%), Total/permanent loss of use/severance of two limbs or sight in both eyes (100%), Third-degree burns (8%+ head or 20%+ body: 100%; 5-8% head or 15-20% body: 50%), Loss of one limb/sight in one eye/hearing in one ear/speech (50%).', 'source_location': 'Page 18, What we pay & Table'}, {'detail_snippet': 'TPD means unable to work in any job/business for 6 consecutive months due to accident and unlikely ever to do so.

*   **Policy Coverage:** General Exclusions (Context)
    *   **Base Limits:** N/A
    *   **Conditional Limits:** N/A
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Participating in sports or activities unless it is for leisure purposes only and available to the general public without restriction', 'source_location': 'Page 31/32, General Exclusions'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met: White Water Rafting, when undertaken as a leisure activity available to the general public, is not typically excluded. Injuries sustained would be covered under the Medical Expenses and Personal Accident benefits, subject to policy terms and limits.

### Requirement: Travel Delay Coverage

*   **Policy Coverage:** Travel delay
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Person (Overseas Delay)', 'limit': 1000, 'basis': 'S$100 for every six hours delay while overseas'}, {'type': 'Per Person (Singapore Delay)', 'limit': 100, 'basis': 'S$100 for the first six hours delay in Singapore only'}]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Payable if scheduled public transport is delayed, or travel forced at another time due to overbooking, for 6 continuous hours or more before reaching scheduled destination.', 'source_location': 'Page 12, Travel delay'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Benefit paid for each 6 continuous hours delayed (except only first 6 hours paid for delay in Singapore). Delay calculated between original and actual arrival time. Requires written proof from provider/agent showing hours and reason.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met: The policy provides a cash benefit of $100 for every 6 hours of delay overseas (up to $1000 total), covering significant delays as requested.

### Requirement: Trip Cancellation Coverage (specifically due to a family wedding)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Trip cancellation and loss of deposit
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Person', 'limit': 15000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Overall limit for family plan', 'limit': 37500, 'basis': None}]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** [{'condition': "With 'Pre-existing medical conditions' cover purchased", 'limits': [{'type': 'Per Person (50% co-payment)', 'limit': 15000, 'basis': None}], 'source_location': 'Page 9, Optional Covers & Page 22'}, {'condition': "With 'Cancel for any reason' cover purchased", 'limits': [{'type': 'Per Person (50% reimbursement)', 'limit': 6000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Overall limit for family plan (50% reimbursement)', 'limit': 15000, 'basis': None}], 'source_location': 'Page 9, Optional Covers & Page 27'}]
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Payable if the entire trip is cancelled within 30 days before scheduled departure due to specified events: serious injury/illness (insured, companion, family member), death (insured, companion, family member), witness in court, serious home damage (fire/natural disaster), serious public event preventing travel, onward flight cancellation (airport/runway/airspace closure, poor weather), hijack >12hrs.', 'source_location': 'Page 10, What events you can claim for'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Covers unused pre-paid accommodation, transport, excursions, tours, activities, and cancellation fees that cannot be recovered.', 'source_location': 'Page 11, What we pay'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Excludes claims if policy purchased less than 72 hours before scheduled departure. Excludes refunds/compensation already received (cash, voucher, credit, points, miles). Excludes expenses for upgrades.', 'source_location': 'Page 11, What is not covered'}, {'detail_snippet': "If claiming under 'Pre-existing medical conditions' cover, cancellation must be a direct result of the condition, 50% co-payment applies.", 'source_location': 'Page 22, Pre-existing medical conditions'}, {'detail_snippet': "If claiming under 'Cancel for any reason' cover, it must be purchased within 7 days of initial trip deposit. Reimburses 50% of covered travel costs for cancellation due to reasons not covered elsewhere.", 'source_location': 'Page 27, Cancel for any reason'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Policy ends if Trip cancellation or Trip postponement benefit is paid under a single trip policy.', 'source_location': 'Page 11, What you should know'}]
*   **Policy Coverage:** Cancel for any reason (Optional Cover)
    *   **Base Limits:** []
    *   **Conditional Limits:** [{'condition': 'Optional add-on purchased', 'limits': [{'type': 'Trip cancellation (50% reimbursement)', 'limit': 6000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Trip cancellation (Family Plan) (50% reimbursement)', 'limit': 15000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Trip postponement (50% reimbursement)', 'limit': 1000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Trip postponement (Family Plan) (50% reimbursement)', 'limit': 2500, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Trip cut short (50% reimbursement)', 'limit': 6000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Trip cut short (Family Plan) (50% reimbursement)', 'limit': 15000, 'basis': None}], 'source_location': 'Page 9, Optional Covers'}]

Policy ends if cancellation/postponement paid.', 'source_location': 'Page 27-28'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Standard trip cancellation does *not* cover cancelling to attend a wedding. The customer's demand for "guaranteed reimbursement" cannot be met. However, purchasing the optional 'Cancel for any reason' add-on (within 7 days of deposit) allows for 50% reimbursement of non-refundable costs up to $6,000 per person for cancellation due to reasons not covered by the standard policy, such as the wedding. This is the best available option but falls short of the customer's specific demand.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: First

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Highest available limits for Medical Expenses ($1M base, $150k pre-ex add-on) and Emergency Evacuation (Unlimited base, $150k pre-ex add-on).
    *   Highest available limits for Luggage loss/damage ($7.5k) and Luggage Delay ($900).
    *   Highest available limit for Travel Delay ($1k).
    *   Highest available limit ($6k) for the 'Cancel for any reason' optional add-on, providing the best possible (though partial) coverage for the critical wedding cancellation scenario.
    *   Covers White Water Rafting under standard leisure activity terms.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Medical Coverage (Pre-existing): Requires purchase of an optional add-on; standard policy excludes it. Limits apply even with the add-on.
    *   Lost/Damaged Luggage: Customer expectation of "immediate reimbursement" is unrealistic; claims process and depreciation apply.
    *   Delayed Luggage: Provides fixed cash benefit after 6 hours, not necessarily immediate funds for essentials.
    *   Trip Cancellation (Wedding): Cannot meet the demand for "guaranteed full reimbursement". Requires purchase of optional 'Cancel for any reason' add-on for only 50% reimbursement up to a $6k limit, and this add-on must be bought within 7 days of the initial trip deposit.
