**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the customer's trip to Japan: All three tiers provide the core types of coverage requested, including Medical, Trip Cancellation, Luggage, Travel Delay, and Accidental Death benefits. Recreational skiing is typically covered under FWD policies as a leisure activity unless specifically excluded, and no such exclusion is noted in the provided data for any tier.

However, a key requirement was confirmation of a double payout for Accidental Death on public transport. Based on the provided JSON data for all three tiers (Premium, Business, First), none explicitly confirm this double payout feature within the Personal Accident benefit details (Page 18 for all tiers). Therefore, this specific aspect of the requirement appears unmet by any tier based on the available information.

The primary difference between the tiers lies in the coverage limits:
*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Medical Overseas, $7.5k Trip Cancellation). While meeting the coverage types, the medical limit might be considered low for a destination like Japan, especially with recreational skiing planned.
*   **Business:** Provides significantly higher limits than Premium (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Trip Cancellation, $5k Luggage). This offers a more robust level of "comprehensive" coverage suitable for the destination and activities.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Trip Cancellation, $7.5k Luggage).

Considering the customer's request for "comprehensive" coverage for Japan and skiing, the Business tier strikes the best balance. It offers substantially better protection than Premium, particularly for medical expenses, aligning better with the potential costs in Japan. While First offers even higher limits, the Business tier's limits are already substantial and provide a strong level of comprehensive cover. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule and the lack of the specific AD double payout confirmation across all tiers, the Business tier represents the most suitable option, offering robust coverage levels that align well with the customer's needs without potentially over-insuring at the higher cost of the First tier.
