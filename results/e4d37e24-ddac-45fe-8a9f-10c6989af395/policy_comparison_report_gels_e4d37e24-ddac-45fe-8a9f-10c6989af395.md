**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers against the customer's requirements:

*   **Basic Tier:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for "Adventurous leisure activities" (Page 5, Section 37), which is necessary for the requested Recreational Skiing. Furthermore, it does not offer the "Public transport double indemnity" benefit (Page 3, Section 2) for accidental death, another critical requirement.
*   **Gold Tier:** This tier meets all the customer's specified requirements. It provides comprehensive medical coverage (SGD 500k overseas limit for adults < 70), trip cancellation (SGD 10k), luggage loss (SGD 5k) and delay coverage. Crucially, it covers "Adventurous leisure activities" including recreational skiing (Page 5, Section 37) and provides the "Public transport double indemnity" benefit (Page 3, Item 2), doubling the accidental death payout (to SGD 500k for adults < 70) under the specified conditions.
*   **Platinum Tier:** This tier also meets all the customer's requirements, offering even higher limits than the Gold tier (e.g., SGD 1M medical, SGD 15k cancellation, SGD 1M AD&D double indemnity) and additional benefits like specific sports equipment cover (Page 5, Section 33) and shorter delay triggers (4 hours vs 6 hours).

**Selection Rationale:** Both the Gold and Platinum tiers fulfill all the customer's stated needs, including the non-negotiable requirements for recreational skiing coverage and the public transport double indemnity benefit. Platinum offers superior limits and some extra features, but Gold adequately meets every specific requirement outlined by the customer with robust coverage levels. Since both tiers are considered fully suitable in meeting the defined requirements, the Tie-Breaking Rule is applied. As Gold appears before Platinum in the price ranking (Cheapest to Most Expensive: Basic, Gold, Platinum), the Gold tier is selected as the most suitable option, providing all necessary coverage at a lower price point compared to Platinum.
