**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, and Elite tiers against the customer's requirements for a comprehensive policy for Japan including recreational skiing:

1.  **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it does not explicitly cover recreational skiing (Amateur Sports Cover appears excluded or N.A. based on provided details, Page 2 & 5). It also has the lowest coverage limits overall.
2.  **Deluxe:** This tier covers recreational skiing (Page 2, Amateur Sports Cover) and meets the basic requirements for medical ($300k), cancellation ($6k), luggage ($5k), and travel delay ($1k max). However, its medical limit is lower than GO Japan! and Elite.
3.  **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for travel to Japan. It covers recreational skiing (Page 2, Amateur Sports Cover) and offers a higher overseas medical limit ($500k) than Deluxe, along with Japan-specific benefits like a cashless medical network (740 clinics/hospitals) and a dedicated EAJ hotline (Page 2). Cancellation ($6k), luggage ($5k), and travel delay ($1k max) limits are comparable to Deluxe.
4.  **Elite:** This tier offers the highest limits across all categories (Medical $1M, Cancellation $15k, Luggage $8k, AD $500k) and covers recreational skiing (Page 1 & 2, Amateur Sports Cover Inclusion).

The customer requires comprehensive coverage, specifically including recreational skiing for a trip to Japan. Both Deluxe, GO Japan!, and Elite cover skiing. The customer also requested confirmation on a double Accidental Death (AD) payout on public transport; however, the provided JSON data for *all* tiers (Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) does not explicitly confirm this specific feature.

Given the destination is Japan, the **GO Japan!** tier is the most suitable. It provides robust medical coverage ($500k) specifically enhanced for Japan with cashless services, directly addressing the customer's need for comprehensive medical care in their destination. It explicitly covers recreational skiing. While it doesn't confirm the AD double payout (a feature unconfirmed across all provided tier data), it offers a tailored and strong package for this specific trip, balancing comprehensive coverage with destination relevance better than Deluxe (lower medical) and likely being more cost-effective than Elite (highest limits but potentially exceeding budget/need). Therefore, GO Japan! is recommended as the best holistic fit based on the requirements and available tier information.
