**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers against the customer's requirements: All tiers provide core coverage for Medical Emergencies, Trip Cancellation, Luggage issues, Travel Delays, and Recreational Skiing (under Adventurous Activities). However, a key requirement is the confirmation of a double payout for accidental death on public transport.

*   The **Classic** tier covers the basics and recreational skiing but explicitly states "NA" (Not Available) for the public transport double cover for accidental death (Section 13). Therefore, it fails to meet this specific, crucial requirement.
*   The **Deluxe** tier meets all the core requirements, covers recreational skiing, and *specifically includes* the public transport double cover for accidental death (Section 13, Conditional Limits), doubling the base accidental death benefit ($200k to $400k for adult under 70).
*   The **Preferred** tier also meets all requirements, including skiing and the double accidental death benefit, offering higher limits across most categories compared to Deluxe (e.g., $1M Medical vs $500k, $500k base AD vs $200k).

While both Deluxe and Preferred meet all stated requirements, the customer did not explicitly request the highest possible limits, only comprehensive coverage including the specific double AD benefit and skiing. Since both Deluxe and Preferred satisfy all requirements, the Tie-Breaking Rule is applied based on the provided price ranking (Classic < Deluxe < Preferred). The Deluxe tier is the cheapest option that fully meets all the customer's specified needs, including the critical double accidental death benefit confirmation.

Therefore, the Deluxe tier is recommended as the most suitable option, providing a complete match for all requirements at a lower price point than the Preferred tier, while the Classic tier is unsuitable due to the lack of the requested double accidental death benefit.
