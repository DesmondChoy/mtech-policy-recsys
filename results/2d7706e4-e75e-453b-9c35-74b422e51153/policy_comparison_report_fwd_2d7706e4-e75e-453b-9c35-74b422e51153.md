**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers against the customer's requirements for a two-week golf trip to Australia: All tiers cover core needs like Emergency Medical, Trip Cancellation, Travel Delays, and Lost/Damaged Luggage, but with significantly different limits. The First tier offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Trip Cancellation, $7.5k Baggage), followed by Business ($500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $5k Baggage), and then Premium ($200k Medical, $7.5k Cancellation, $3k Baggage).

Crucially, none of the FWD tiers inherently cover all the specific golf requirements. Coverage for Golf Equipment requires purchasing the *optional* "Sports equipment protector" add-on, available across all tiers ($2000 limit, excludes damage during play). Specific benefits for Reimbursement for Unused Green Fees, Accidental Damage to Rented Golf Buggy (Personal Liability excludes motorised vehicles, and Car Rental Excess cover is specific to cars), and a Hole-in-One Benefit are **not explicitly offered** in any of the FWD tiers or the optional Sports add-on.

Given the "No Mix-and-Match" rule, the customer must select one tier. Since the unique golf requirements (beyond basic equipment protection via add-on) are unmet by all tiers, the decision prioritizes the best coverage for the core requirements, especially Medical and Cancellation, which the customer emphasized. The First tier provides the most comprehensive protection with the highest limits, aligning best with the desire for robust coverage for a trip to Australia where medical costs can be high. While it doesn't fulfill every golf-specific request, it offers the strongest foundation for the standard travel risks. The customer must be advised that the "Sports equipment protector" add-on is necessary for equipment coverage and that the other specific golf benefits are not included.

Therefore, the First tier is recommended due to its superior limits for essential coverage like medical expenses and trip cancellation, providing the most comprehensive protection among the available FWD options, despite the identified gaps in specific golf-related benefits which are absent across all FWD tiers.
