**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, and Elite tiers for the customer's two-week trip to Australia with specific golf requirements:

*   **Vital:** This tier offers the lowest coverage limits overall and, crucially, lacks any specific 'Golf Cover' benefits. It does not meet the customer's non-negotiable requirements for golf equipment, unused green fees, buggy damage, or hole-in-one benefits.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier provides moderate core coverage but only partially addresses the golf needs. Under its 'Golf Cover' (Section 36), it covers loss/damage to golf equipment up to $500 but explicitly states Hole-in-one, Unused green fees, and Damage of buggy are 'N.A.' (Not Applicable). This fails to meet several key customer requirements.
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is designed specifically for travel to Japan and is therefore unsuitable for the customer's trip to Australia. Even if considered, its golf coverage is identical to the Deluxe tier (equipment only, others N.A.).
*   **Elite:** This tier offers the highest limits for core benefits like Emergency Medical ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), and Baggage ($8k), aligning with the customer's desire for "proper" coverage. Most importantly, it is the *only* tier with a comprehensive 'Golf Cover' section (Section 36) that explicitly includes benefits for:
    *   Loss or damage of golf equipment (up to $1000)
    *   Hole-in-one (up to $500)
    *   Unused green fees (up to $250)
    *   Damage of buggy (up to $500)

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must select one complete tier), the Elite tier is the only option from SOMPO that fulfills all the customer's specific and non-negotiable golf-related requirements, alongside providing the highest level of general travel insurance protection.

Therefore, the Elite tier is recommended as the single most suitable option, directly addressing all stated requirements, including the critical need for comprehensive golf coverage.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides comprehensive and specific coverage for all requested golf-related activities (equipment, green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one) via the dedicated 'Golf Cover' section, fulfilling a critical and non-negotiable customer requirement.
    *   Offers the highest coverage limits among SOMPO tiers for core benefits like Emergency Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), Travel Delay ($2k), and Baggage ($8k).
    *   Includes Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for travellers under 70.
    *   Covers Amateur Sports, which includes golf.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   While coverage types are met, the specific sub-limits within the Golf Cover section ($1000 for equipment, $250 for green fees, $500 for buggy damage, $500 for hole-in-one) might be lower than the customer's potential expenses or equipment value, although no specific values were requested by the customer.
    *   The Hole-in-One benefit typically requires the event to occur during an official competition (as per standard policy wordings, though not explicitly stated in the provided snippet).
