**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers: The Basic tier is unsuitable as it completely lacks the specific golf-related coverages (equipment, green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one) explicitly requested by the customer under Section 32 ('Golfer's cover'). The Gold tier meets all the customer's requirements, including the core travel needs (Medical, Cancellation, Delay, Luggage) and the specific golf coverages (Section 32: S$500 equipment, S$250 green fees, S$250 hole-in-one; Section 31: S$1000 rental vehicle excess). However, the Platinum tier also meets all requirements but offers significantly higher coverage limits, which aligns better with the customer's emphasis on "comprehensive" and "proper" coverage, particularly regarding potentially high medical costs in Australia ("proper medical coverage, not some token amount") and potential cancellation losses ("thousands on flights and hotels"). Platinum provides S$1M for overseas medical expenses (vs. S$500k in Gold), S$15k for trip cancellation (vs. S$10k in Gold), S$8k for baggage loss (vs. S$5k in Gold), S$1k for golf equipment (vs. S$500 in Gold), and S$1.5k for rental vehicle excess (vs. S$1k in Gold).

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule prevents combining features, and the customer's stated need for comprehensive coverage including specific, non-negotiable golf benefits, the Platinum tier is recommended. Although Gold meets the minimum requirements, Platinum provides a higher level of financial protection across key areas, better reflecting the customer's desire for robust coverage for their golf trip.
