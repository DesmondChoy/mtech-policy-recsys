**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** Fails to meet key requirements. It explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions like asthma (Section 3 & 4 Note, Section 5, Section 38) and does not cover adventurous leisure activities like hiking (Section 37). Trip cancellation coverage is low ($2000) and unlikely to cover the specific 'sister's wedding' reason, lacking a 'cancel for any reason' benefit.
*   **Gold:** Addresses several gaps in Basic. It covers adventurous leisure activities like hiking (Section 37) and offers an *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions like asthma (Section 38), covering medical expenses ($150k limit, $100 co-pay outpatient) and related issues. It includes 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' (Section 19), offering potential coverage (up to $3k limit, likely 50% payout) for the sister's wedding cancellation if purchased within 30 days of booking. Core limits are significantly higher than Basic (e.g., $500k medical, $10k cancellation, $5k luggage).
*   **Platinum:** Builds upon Gold with the highest limits and enhanced benefits. It also covers hiking (Section 37) and offers the *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions like asthma, but with higher limits than Gold's add-on (e.g., $200k medical, $200k evacuation - Section 38). Crucially, the 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit has a higher limit ($6k - Section 19), offering better potential coverage for the sister's wedding cancellation scenario (subject to conditions). It also features higher core limits ($1M medical, $15k cancellation, $8k luggage) and faster payouts for travel delays (triggering at 4 hours vs 6 hours - Section 21).

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. Basic is unsuitable. Both Gold and Platinum require the pre-existing condition add-on to cover asthma. While Gold + Add-on meets the basic requirements, Platinum + Add-on provides a significantly better fit due to:
1.  Higher coverage limits for the pre-existing condition (asthma).
2.  A higher limit ($6k vs $3k) for the 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit, which is the most likely way to get coverage for the specific 'sister's wedding' cancellation reason.
3.  Overall higher limits and faster delay payouts, offering more comprehensive protection.

Therefore, the **Platinum** tier (with the necessary pre-existing condition add-on purchased) is recommended as it provides the most robust coverage for all stated requirements, particularly addressing the pre-existing condition and the specific cancellation concern more effectively than the Gold tier.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Platinum

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides the highest available coverage limits for core requirements like medical expenses ($1M), evacuation ($1M), baggage loss ($8k), and standard trip cancellation ($15k).
    *   Offers an optional add-on to cover the pre-existing condition (asthma) with higher limits ($200k medical, $200k evacuation) compared to the Gold tier add-on.
    *   Explicitly covers adventurous leisure activities, including hiking.
    *   Includes a 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit with a higher limit ($6k) than Gold, offering better potential coverage for the specific 'sister's wedding' cancellation scenario (subject to conditions).
    *   Travel delay benefits trigger faster (4 hours) and have higher limits ($2k overseas) than lower tiers.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Coverage for the pre-existing condition (asthma) requires the purchase of an *additional* add-on benefit at extra cost.
    *   Trip cancellation specifically due to the sister's wedding is only potentially covered under the 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit, which likely involves a 50% co-payment (paying 50% of non-refundable costs up to the $6k limit) and requires the policy to be purchased within 30 days of the initial travel booking. It is not covered under standard trip cancellation terms.
