**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) for this customer's 10-day trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes Emergency Medical Evacuation cover for pre-existing conditions like asthma (Section 4) and lacks specific coverage for amateur sports like hiking (Page 2 Highlights & Section 28 N.A.).
*   **Deluxe:** Offers basic coverage for the core requirements, including hiking (trekking up to 3,500m) and provides a $100k limit for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions. However, its overseas medical limit ($300k) is lower than GO Japan!.
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for travel to Japan. It covers hiking (trekking up to 3,500m) and provides the same $100k Emergency Medical Evacuation limit for pre-existing conditions as Deluxe. Crucially, it offers a higher overseas medical limit ($500k) than Deluxe and includes Japan-specific benefits like cashless medical services at numerous clinics/hospitals and a dedicated Emergency Assistance Japan (EAJ) hotline.
*   **Elite:** Provides the highest coverage limits across the board, including a $1M overseas medical limit and a $150k limit for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions. It also covers hiking.

While Elite offers the highest limits, the **GO Japan!** tier is recommended as the single most suitable option. It provides robust coverage levels ($500k medical, $6k cancellation, $5k luggage) that meet the customer's core needs, explicitly covers hiking, and includes a specific limit for pre-existing condition evacuation ($100k). Critically, its Japan-specific features (cashless medical, EAJ hotline) offer significant practical advantages and convenience for this particular destination, making it a better holistic fit than Deluxe. Although Elite has higher limits, GO Japan! offers a strong balance of coverage and destination-specific benefits at likely a lower price point than Elite (GO Japan! is ranked below Elite in price). The requirement for trip cancellation due to a sister's wedding is highly unlikely to be covered under the standard "Insured Events" of *any* tier, including Elite, as this is typically not considered an unforeseen event triggering cancellation coverage. Therefore, GO Japan! provides the best combination of relevant coverage and practical benefits for this specific trip.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: While general medical treatment and evacuation (including a $100k limit for pre-existing conditions like asthma) are covered, standard travel insurance policies typically exclude non-emergency medical expenses arising from pre-existing conditions. Coverage for asthma-related medical treatment would likely only apply if it's a life-threatening emergency. The cashless service in Japan is a significant benefit *if* the treatment qualifies for coverage.

Includes coverage for loss of frequent flyer or similar travel points used to purchase an airline ticket.', 'source_location': 'Page 4, Section 13 & Page 2, Trip Cancellation or Postponement'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Not Met: The specific reason requested ("sister's wedding") is not typically listed as a covered "Insured Event" in standard travel insurance policies, which usually require unforeseen circumstances like serious illness/death, natural disaster, etc. Cancellation due to a known potential scheduling conflict like a wedding date is generally excluded.

### Requirement: pre_existing_conditions (asthma)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation (Including Mortal Remains) Back to Singapore
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person - up to 70 years (Pre-existing Conditions)', 'limit': 100000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - above 70 years (Pre-existing Conditions)', 'limit': 50000, 'basis': None}]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
