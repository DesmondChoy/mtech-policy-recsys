## Final Recommendation
Based on a detailed analysis of your requirements against available policies, the recommended policy is:

**GELS - Platinum**

### Justification
The GELS Platinum policy, combined with its optional 'Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit', emerges as the single best overall choice after comparing the three finalists (FWD First, GELS Platinum, INCOME Preferred).

Here's a comparative justification:

1.  **Pre-existing Condition (Asthma) Coverage:** This is a critical requirement. 
    *   INCOME Preferred's standard plan does not cover this based on the report, making it unsuitable.
    *   FWD First requires an add-on providing $150k medical/evacuation cover (Source: FWD Report, Page 9, Optional Covers & Page 24).
    *   GELS Platinum requires an add-on but offers superior limits of $200k for medical expenses overseas and $200k for evacuation related to the pre-existing condition (Source: GELS Report, Page 5, Section 38 a, c, d). While GELS has a $100 co-pay for outpatient PEC treatment and a 50% co-pay for PEC-related cancellation/disruption (Source: GELS Report, Page 5, Section 38 & Footnote #), the significantly higher overall medical limit ($200k vs $150k) provides a greater safety net for potentially serious asthma complications, making it preferable over FWD First.

2.  **Trip Cancellation (Sister's Wedding):** This specific, non-standard reason requires 'Cancel For Any Reason' (CFAR) or similar coverage.
    *   INCOME Preferred lacks this feature based on the report.
    *   FWD First requires a separate 'Cancel for any reason' add-on, offering 50% reimbursement up to $6k, but crucially, this add-on must be purchased within 7 days of the initial trip deposit (Source: FWD Report, Page 9, Optional Covers & Page 27). This is a very restrictive timeframe.
    *   GELS Platinum includes a 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit directly within the Platinum tier (Source: GELS Report, Page 4, Section 19). While it also likely offers a 50% payout up to a $6k limit for cancellation, it provides a more reasonable condition: the *policy* must be purchased within 30 days of the initial travel booking or deposit (Source: GELS Report, Page 2 Footnote * & Page 6). This longer window and integration into the main plan make GELS Platinum more practical and accessible for this specific requirement compared to FWD First.

3.  **Other Benefits:**
    *   **Hiking:** Both FWD First and GELS Platinum cover standard/adventurous hiking (Source: FWD Report implicitly; GELS Report, Page 5, Section 37).
    *   **Luggage:** GELS Platinum ($8k - Section 22) offers slightly higher limits than FWD First ($7.5k - Page 14).
    *   **Travel Delay:** GELS Platinum offers a higher limit ($2k overseas vs $1k) and a faster payout trigger (every 4 hours vs every 6 hours) compared to FWD First (Source: GELS Report, Page 4, Section 21; FWD Report, Page 12).

**Trade-offs and Conclusion:** While FWD First addresses the core needs via add-ons, GELS Platinum requires only one add-on (for PEC) and integrates the 'any reason' cancellation benefit more favourably. GELS Platinum provides superior coverage limits for the critical pre-existing condition ($200k vs $150k medical) and better travel delay benefits. Although GELS has specific co-pays for its PEC add-on, the higher coverage limits and more user-friendly conditions for the 'any reason' cancellation make GELS Platinum the most robust and suitable option overall, best aligning with the customer's key requirements despite the need for the PEC add-on purchase.
