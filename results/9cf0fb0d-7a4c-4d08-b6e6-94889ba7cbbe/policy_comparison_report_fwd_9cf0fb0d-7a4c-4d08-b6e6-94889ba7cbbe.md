**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers require the purchase of optional add-ons to cover the customer's key concerns: the pre-existing condition (asthma) and trip cancellation due to a family event (sister's wedding).

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits for both the 'Pre-existing medical conditions' (PEC) add-on ($50k Medical Overseas, $7.5k Cancellation with 50% co-pay) and the 'Cancel for any reason' (CFAR) add-on ($1k limit, 50% reimbursement). These limits may be insufficient given the potential costs associated with asthma complications overseas or cancelling a trip to Japan.
*   **Business:** Provides moderate limits ($100k PEC Medical Overseas, $10k PEC Cancellation with 50% co-pay; $3k CFAR limit, 50% reimbursement). This is an improvement over Premium but still might not offer complete peace of mind, especially for the CFAR scenario (only covering up to $6k trip cost at 50%).
*   **First:** Offers the highest available limits for the crucial add-ons ($150k PEC Medical Overseas, $15k PEC Cancellation with 50% co-pay; $6k CFAR limit, 50% reimbursement). It also provides the highest base limits for standard medical expenses ($1M), luggage ($7.5k), and travel delay ($1k).

The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose one tier. While First is the most expensive, it provides the most comprehensive coverage and highest limits specifically addressing the customer's primary concerns: medical treatment considering asthma (via the highest PEC add-on limits) and the specific trip cancellation scenario (via the highest CFAR add-on limit, albeit partial coverage). The significantly higher limits for core benefits also better meet the general requirements for travel to a destination like Japan.

Therefore, the First tier is recommended as it offers the most robust protection tailored to the customer's specific health needs (asthma requiring PEC cover) and cancellation request (requiring CFAR cover), alongside superior general coverage limits compared to the Premium and Business tiers.
