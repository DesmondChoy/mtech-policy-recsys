**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the customer's trip to Japan: All tiers cover core requirements like medical emergencies, trip cancellation, travel delay, and lost/damaged luggage, but with varying limits. Crucially, all tiers require the purchase of the *optional* 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on to cover the declared high blood pressure, and the *optional* 'Sports equipment protector' add-on for golf equipment coverage (theft/damage/loss, not damage during play).

None of the FWD tiers, based on the provided policy details, offer coverage for the specific requests of unused green fees reimbursement, golf buggy damage liability (Personal Liability excludes motorised vehicles, and Car Rental Excess is for cars), or a hole-in-one benefit.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must select one complete tier plus chosen add-ons) and the lack of coverage for some specific golf needs across all tiers, the decision focuses on the best fit for the core requirements, pre-existing condition coverage, and golf equipment protection.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k base medical, $7.5k cancellation, $50k pre-existing medical cover with 50% co-pay for some benefits). This might be insufficient, especially considering potential medical costs in Japan and the pre-existing condition. Car rental excess is also optional.
*   **Business:** Provides mid-range limits (e.g., $500k base medical, $10k cancellation, $100k pre-existing medical cover). Includes $500 car rental excess as standard. Offers a reasonable balance.
*   **First:** Delivers the highest limits (e.g., $1M base medical, $15k cancellation, $150k pre-existing medical cover, $150k pre-existing evacuation cover). Includes $1000 car rental excess as standard.

While Business offers solid coverage, the **First** tier is recommended as the *most suitable*. The significantly higher limits for medical expenses (both base and pre-existing condition cover), emergency evacuation related to pre-existing conditions, trip cancellation, and luggage provide a substantially greater safety net. This is particularly relevant given the travel destination (Japan, potentially high medical costs) and the declared pre-existing condition (high blood pressure), making the higher protection levels offered by First more appropriate than the mid-range Business or lower-range Premium tiers, despite First being the most expensive option. The required add-ons for pre-existing conditions and sports equipment are available for this tier.
