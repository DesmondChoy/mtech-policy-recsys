**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All three tiers provide core coverage for medical emergencies, trip cancellation, travel delay, and lost/damaged luggage, but with increasing limits from Classic to Preferred. However, a critical requirement – coverage for pre-existing conditions (high blood pressure) – is explicitly **not met** by any of these standard tiers, as they exclude claims arising from such conditions. Furthermore, none of the tiers offer specific, dedicated benefits for the requested golf coverages: unused green fees reimbursement, golf buggy damage liability, or a hole-in-one benefit. Golf equipment would only be covered under the general 'Loss or damage of baggage and personal belongings' section, subject to per-item and overall limits, which might be insufficient for expensive clubs. Golf buggy damage liability is unlikely to be covered under standard Personal Liability or Rental Vehicle Excess.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule and the fact that none of the tiers fully meet all requirements (especially the pre-existing condition and specific golf benefits), the choice must be based on which tier offers the best available coverage for the *other* requirements. The Preferred tier provides the highest limits across all standard categories: Medical Expenses Overseas (S$1,000,000 for under 70s), Trip Cancellation (S$15,000), Baggage Loss (S$8,000 overall, S$500 per item), and Personal Liability (S$1,000,000). These higher limits offer the best chance of adequately covering standard travel risks and provide the highest potential coverage for valuable golf equipment under the general baggage benefit, even if specific golf cover is absent.

Therefore, the **Preferred** tier is recommended as the "least unsuitable" option among the three standard tiers provided. It offers the highest protection levels for the covered risks, although it crucially fails to meet the pre-existing condition coverage need and lacks the specific golf benefits requested. The customer must be made aware of these significant gaps, particularly the lack of cover for claims related to high blood pressure under this standard plan.

### Requirement: golf equipment coverage

*   **Policy Coverage:** Loss or damage of baggage and personal belongings
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Overall section limit - Per insured person', 'limit': 8000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Overall section limit - Family total', 'limit': 20000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Limit for laptop - Per insured person', 'limit': 1000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Limit for watches, jewellery or valuables in total - Per insured person', 'limit': 750, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Limit for other items (for each item, set or pair) - Per insured person', 'limit': 500, 'basis': None}]

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Golf equipment falls under general baggage. While the overall limit is high (S$8,000), the per-item limit (S$500) is likely insufficient for individual high-value clubs or a full set if considered one item. No specific golf equipment benefit exists.

### Requirement: unused green fees reimbursement

*   **Policy Coverage:** Not explicitly covered
    *   **Base Limits:** N/A
    *   **Conditional Limits:** N/A
    *   **Source Specific Details:** N/A

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Not Met: Personal Liability typically excludes damage to property in your care/control (like a rented buggy). Rental Vehicle Excess usually applies only to licensed road vehicles (cars), not golf buggies. No specific benefit covers this.

*   **Policy Coverage:** General Exclusions / Conditions
    *   **Base Limits:** N/A
    *   **Conditional Limits:** N/A

Policy wording would need final confirmation, but standard INCOME plans generally exclude this.
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Not Met: Standard plans exclude claims arising from pre-existing conditions, even if declared.

### Requirement: medical_needs (standard emergency medical coverage)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Medical expenses overseas
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Adult 70 years old or over (combined for sections 14, 18 and 19)', 'limit': 350000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Adult under 70 years old', 'limit': 1000000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Child', 'limit': 300000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Family total', 'limit': 3000000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Limit for medical aids and equipment - Per insured person', 'limit': 1500, 'basis': None}]
