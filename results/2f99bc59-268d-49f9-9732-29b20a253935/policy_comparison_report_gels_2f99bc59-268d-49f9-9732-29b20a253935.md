**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers: The Basic tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions (a key requirement for the customer's high blood pressure) and offers no specific 'Golfer's cover', failing to meet the customer's detailed golf-related needs (equipment, green fees, buggy liability inquiry, hole-in-one).

Both the Gold and Platinum tiers offer the necessary specific 'Golfer's cover' benefits (equipment, unused green fees, hole-in-one) and provide an *optional add-on* for pre-existing condition (PEC) coverage, which is essential for this customer. Assuming the customer purchases the PEC add-on (required for either Gold or Platinum to meet their needs), the choice is between these two tiers.

The Platinum tier is recommended over the Gold tier due to its significantly higher coverage limits across several key areas relevant to the customer's requirements. Platinum offers double the limit for Golf Equipment ($1000 vs $500 on Gold), which directly addresses the customer's concern about expensive clubs. It also provides higher limits for core benefits like Overseas Medical Expenses ($1M vs $500k), Trip Cancellation ($15k vs $10k), and Baggage Loss ($8k vs $5k). Furthermore, Platinum offers better Travel Delay terms ($100 payout every 4 hours vs every 6 hours on Gold) and higher Rental Vehicle Excess cover ($1500 vs $1000), which may be relevant for potential golf buggy damage excess claims. While the specific 'golf buggy damage liability' isn't explicitly listed under Golfer's Cover in either tier, Platinum's higher Personal Liability and Rental Vehicle Excess limits offer potentially better protection.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. Platinum provides the most comprehensive coverage package that aligns best with the customer's stated needs for robust core coverage, specific golf protection (especially for valuable equipment), and the necessary (add-on) coverage for their pre-existing condition, despite likely being the most expensive option.

    *   Coverage for the pre-existing condition (high blood pressure) requires the purchase of an *additional* optional benefit at extra cost.
