**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, and Elite tiers for the customer's trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it lacks specific coverage for amateur sports like skiing and explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under the Emergency Medical Evacuation benefit, failing key customer requirements.
*   **Deluxe:** Offers skiing cover and includes Emergency Medical Evacuation for pre-existing conditions (up to $100k). However, its overall limits ($300k Medical, $6k Cancellation, $5k Luggage) are moderate.
*   **GO Japan!:** Specifically designed for Japan, offering a higher medical limit ($500k) than Deluxe, skiing cover, pre-existing condition evacuation cover ($100k), and Japan-specific cashless medical services. Its cancellation ($6k) and luggage ($5k) limits are the same as Deluxe. This is a strong contender due to the destination-specific benefits.
*   **Elite:** Provides the highest coverage limits across all key areas ($1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage) and the highest limit for pre-existing condition evacuation ($150k). It also covers skiing.

The customer requires comprehensive coverage, specifically mentioning medical expenses for pre-existing conditions (asthma) and skiing injuries. While the provided JSON data for Deluxe, GO Japan!, and Elite only explicitly confirms *evacuation* coverage for pre-existing conditions (not necessarily general medical treatment costs arising from them, which may be excluded under standard terms unless specified otherwise), Elite offers the highest limit ($150k) for this evacuation benefit. Furthermore, Elite's significantly higher limits for overall medical, trip cancellation, and luggage align best with the request for "comprehensive" protection. Although GO Japan! offers attractive Japan-specific cashless services, the substantially higher core coverage limits of the Elite tier make it the most suitable choice to meet the customer's desire for comprehensive cover, acknowledging the No Mix-and-Match rule prevents combining GO Japan!'s features with Elite's limits.

Therefore, the Elite tier is recommended as it provides the highest available limits for the customer's key requirements, including the highest specific limit for pre-existing condition evacuation, and covers the required activity (skiing).

Further clarification from the full policy wording is advised for this specific aspect.

### Requirement: additional_requests (Clarification on coverage for family event trip cancellations)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Trip Cancellation or Postponement
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person', 'limit': 15000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 25000, 'basis': None}]

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Not Met: Standard 'Insured Events' typically cover unforeseen circumstances like death, serious injury/illness of the insured or close relative, natural disasters, strikes, etc. Cancellation due to a change in a family event date (like a sister's wedding) is generally not considered a standard Insured Event and is unlikely to be covered.

### Requirement: additional_requests (details of reimbursement process for delayed luggage)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Baggage Delay
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person', 'limit': 125, 'basis': '$200 for 1st full 6 hours (overseas) or $150 for 1st full 6 hours (Singapore), $125 per full 4 hours thereafter (overseas)'}, {'type': 'Maximum Limit', 'limit': 1000, 'basis': None}]

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: The policy provides a cash benefit for baggage delay exceeding 6 hours. However, the provided JSON data focuses on the benefit payout structure and does not detail the specific reimbursement *process* for purchasing essential items during the delay. This information is typically found in the claims procedure section of the full policy wording.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Highest available limits for Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), and Baggage Loss ($8k), aligning with the desire for comprehensive cover.
    *   Explicitly covers snow-skiing under Amateur Sports Cover.
    *   Provides the highest limit ($150k for under 70s) for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions among the tiers.
    *   Covers travel delay from the 6th hour onwards with a high maximum limit ($2k).
    *   Includes numerous other benefits like high hospital allowances, personal liability, etc.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Pre-existing Conditions (Asthma): While evacuation is covered up to a limit, coverage for general overseas medical expenses arising from asthma is not explicitly confirmed in the provided JSON and may be excluded. Requires verification from full policy wording.
    *   Family Event Trip Cancellation: The specific scenario (sister's wedding date change) is unlikely to be covered under standard trip cancellation reasons.
    *   Delayed Luggage Reimbursement Process: The provided data details the cash benefit but not the specific process/requirements for claiming reimbursement for essential items purchased during a delay. Requires verification from full policy wording/claims information.
