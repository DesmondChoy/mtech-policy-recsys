**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers against the customer's requirements: All tiers cover the core needs like medical expenses, baggage, travel delay, and trip cancellation, and all require the purchase of an optional add-on for pre-existing conditions (asthma). Skiing injuries are covered under standard medical benefits in all tiers.

However, the tiers differ significantly in coverage limits.
*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Overseas Medical, $50k Pre-existing Medical add-on, $7.5k Trip Cancellation, $3k Baggage). The 'Cancel for any reason' add-on limit is only $1k. This might be insufficient for a comprehensive need, especially considering the pre-existing condition and potential costs in Japan.
*   **Business:** Provides a substantial increase in limits (e.g., $500k Overseas Medical, $100k Pre-existing Medical add-on, $10k Trip Cancellation, $5k Baggage). The 'Cancel for any reason' add-on limit is $3k. This tier offers a balanced and robust level of coverage across all requested areas.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Overseas Medical, $150k Pre-existing Medical add-on, $15k Trip Cancellation, $7.5k Baggage) and the highest 'Cancel for any reason' add-on limit ($6k). While offering the most coverage, it is also the most expensive tier and may exceed the customer's needs and implied budget.

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must select a single tier. The Business tier provides a significantly more comprehensive safety net than the Premium tier, particularly for medical expenses (including the pre-existing condition add-on) and cancellation flexibility (via the higher 'Cancel for any reason' add-on limit), aligning better with the request for "comprehensive" coverage. While First offers higher limits, Business represents the most suitable balance of robust coverage and likely value for this customer's specific requirements.

Therefore, the Business tier is recommended as it provides a strong, balanced level of coverage across all key requirements, including adequate limits for medical (with pre-existing condition add-on), skiing injury, luggage, delay, and cancellation (including the option for 'Cancel for any reason'), offering a significant step up from Premium without the potentially unnecessary expense of First.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Business

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides high limits for core requirements like Overseas Medical Expenses ($500k) and Emergency Evacuation (Unlimited).
    *   Offers substantial optional coverage for Pre-existing Conditions ($100k Medical, $100k Evac, $10k Cancellation with 50% co-pay).
    *   Covers medical expenses related to skiing injuries under standard benefits.
    *   Good coverage limits for Baggage Loss/Damage ($5k) and Travel Delay ($500).
    *   Includes a reasonable limit ($3k, 50% reimbursement) for the optional 'Cancel for any reason' add-on, potentially addressing the family event cancellation query if purchased timely.
    *   Provides clear details on the cash benefit payout structure for Baggage Delay.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Standard Trip Cancellation does not cover cancellation due to family events like a wedding date change; requires the timely purchase of the optional 'Cancel for any reason' add-on for partial coverage.
    *   Coverage for Pre-existing Conditions requires purchasing an optional add-on and involves co-payments for certain benefits (Cancellation, Cut Short, Disruption).
    *   Baggage Delay benefit is a cash payout per 6 hours, not a direct reimbursement process for specific essential items purchased (though the cash can be used for this).
