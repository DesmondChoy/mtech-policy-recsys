**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions (like the customer's asthma) and does not cover adventurous leisure activities, which includes the requested skiing coverage.
*   **Gold:** This tier covers adventurous leisure activities (skiing). Crucially, it offers an *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions (asthma), covering associated medical expenses, evacuation, and trip changes (subject to limits and co-payments). It meets the travel delay requirement (payout after 6 hours) and luggage needs. It also includes a "Travel inconvenience for any reason" benefit, which could potentially address the customer's query about cancelling for a family event (sister's wedding change), albeit with specific limits, conditions (purchase timing), and a likely 50% payout structure.
*   **Platinum:** This tier also covers skiing and offers the same optional pre-existing condition add-on (with slightly higher limits). It provides higher overall limits than Gold for medical, cancellation, and luggage. It features a shorter delay trigger (4 hours vs. 6 hours) and adds specific sports equipment cover. While offering enhanced benefits, these exceed the customer's explicitly stated minimum requirements (e.g., 6-hour delay).

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. Both Gold and Platinum can meet the core requirements *if the pre-existing condition add-on is purchased*. Gold (with the add-on) provides comprehensive coverage for all specified needs: medical including pre-existing asthma, skiing injuries, luggage, travel delay (meeting the 6-hour threshold), and trip cancellation (including potential coverage for the family event scenario via the 'any reason' benefit). Platinum offers more (higher limits, shorter delay trigger, sports equipment cover), but Gold adequately fulfills the stated requirements.

Therefore, the **Gold** tier (with the mandatory purchase of the **Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit**) is recommended as the most suitable option. It holistically addresses all key requirements comprehensively without potentially over-insuring compared to the Platinum tier's enhancements, and aligns better with the principle of cost-effectiveness implied by the price ranking and budget preference. The purchase of the pre-existing condition add-on is essential for this recommendation to be valid.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Gold

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides coverage for pre-existing conditions (asthma) via the essential add-on purchase.
    *   Covers adventurous activities, including skiing.
    *   Includes "Travel inconvenience for any reason" benefit, offering potential (limited) coverage for non-standard cancellation reasons like the family event.
    *   Meets the specified 6-hour trigger for travel and baggage delay benefits.
    *   Offers substantial limits for core medical, luggage, and standard cancellation needs.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Requires the mandatory purchase of the **Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit** at an additional cost to cover asthma-related issues.
    *   Trip cancellation for the specific family event (sister's wedding change) falls under the "any reason" benefit, which has a lower limit ($3k), specific conditions (purchase timing), and likely a 50% payout structure, meaning full reimbursement is unlikely.
    *   Claims related to pre-existing conditions under the add-on (e.g., trip cancellation/postponement/disruption) are subject to a 50% co-payment. Outpatient medical treatment for pre-existing conditions under the add-on has a S$100 co-payment per visit.
