**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

The customer requires standard travel insurance (medical, cancellation, luggage, delay) for a 10-day trip to Japan, with a critical need for specific golf coverage: protection for golf clubs, reimbursement for unused green fees due to illness/injury, cover for damage to a golf buggy, and a hole-in-one benefit.

Comparing the available SOMPO TravelJoy tiers:
*   **Vital:** Lacks any specific golf coverage benefits (Section 36 N.A. or not listed). It only covers the standard requirements with lower limits.
*   **Deluxe:** Includes cover for loss/damage to golf equipment ($500 limit) but explicitly excludes cover for hole-in-one, unused green fees, and damage to a buggy (Section 36 lists these as N.A.).
*   **GO Japan!:** Similar to Deluxe, it covers golf equipment loss/damage ($500 limit) but explicitly excludes the other required golf benefits (hole-in-one, unused green fees, buggy damage - Section 36 N.A.). While tailored for Japan with features like cashless medical networks, it fails on the specific activity coverage.
*   **Elite:** Provides the highest limits for standard coverage (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage) and, crucially, includes a dedicated 'Golf Cover' section (Section 36) that explicitly covers all the customer's specific requests: loss/damage of golf equipment ($1000), hole-in-one ($500), unused green fees ($250), and damage of buggy ($500).

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must select one complete tier) and the explicit requirement for comprehensive golf coverage, only the Elite tier holistically meets all stated needs. The Vital, Deluxe, and GO Japan! tiers are unsuitable due to their failure to provide the required golf-specific benefits. Therefore, the Elite tier is recommended as the single most suitable option. The Tie-Breaking Rule was not required as only one tier met all requirements.
