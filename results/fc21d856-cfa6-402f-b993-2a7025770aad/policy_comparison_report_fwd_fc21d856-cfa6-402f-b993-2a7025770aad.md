**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the customer's trip to Japan: All tiers cover the core requirements of emergency medical, trip cancellation, lost/damaged luggage, and travel delay, with limits increasing from Premium to Business to First. However, a critical requirement is specific golf coverage, including clubs, unused green fees, buggy damage liability, and a hole-in-one benefit.

None of the FWD tiers include comprehensive golf coverage as standard. The "Sports equipment protector" is an *optional add-on* available for all tiers, offering the same $2,000 limit for equipment loss/damage (excluding damage during use) and rental replacement. Crucially, this add-on *does not cover* unused green fees, damage to a golf buggy (Personal Liability in all tiers excludes motorised vehicles), or a hole-in-one benefit.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must choose one tier with its available add-ons), and the fact that the specific golf requirements beyond equipment protection are unmet by *any* FWD tier, the decision rests on which tier best covers the core needs while allowing the addition of the Sports Equipment Protector for the clubs.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits ($200k Medical, $7.5k Cancellation, $3k Baggage). While cheapest, the medical limit might be low for Japan, and other limits are modest.
*   **Business:** Provides significantly higher limits ($500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $5k Baggage), offering a more robust safety net for standard emergency needs, which aligns better with travel to a potentially expensive destination like Japan.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits ($1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $7.5k Baggage), which may exceed "standard" requirements and likely comes at a higher cost.

The Business tier strikes the best balance. It offers substantially better core coverage than Premium, providing greater peace of mind for medical emergencies and cancellations, while remaining potentially more cost-effective than the First tier. Although it fails to meet the specific golf requirements for green fees, buggy damage, and hole-in-one (as do the other tiers), it provides solid core coverage and allows the addition of the Sports Equipment Protector to cover the golf clubs (partially meeting that aspect of the golf requirement). Therefore, Business is recommended as the most suitable option among the available FWD tiers, despite the noted gaps in specific golf coverage.

Therefore, the overall golf coverage requirement is not met.
