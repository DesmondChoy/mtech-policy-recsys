**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) for the customer's 3-week trip to Europe:

1.  **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for travel to Japan and is unsuitable for the customer's European destination.
2.  **Vital:** This tier offers the lowest coverage limits for key areas like Medical ($150k), Trip Cancellation ($5k), and Luggage ($3k). Crucially, it lacks the explicit "Amateur Sports Cover" found in higher tiers, meaning the required Hiking Activities Coverage is not guaranteed or clearly defined.
3.  **Deluxe:** This tier provides moderate coverage limits (Medical $300k, Cancellation $6k, Luggage $5k) and explicitly includes "Amateur Sports Cover" which covers trekking up to 3,500m, meeting the Hiking requirement.
4.  **Elite:** This tier offers the highest coverage limits (Medical $1M, Cancellation $15k, Luggage $8k, Travel Delay max $2k) and also explicitly includes the necessary "Amateur Sports Cover" for hiking.

The customer requires comprehensive coverage, has a flexible budget, and specifically needs cover for Medical, Cancellation, Luggage, Delays, and Hiking. While no SOMPO tier explicitly covers the requested "Pet Accommodation Costs" due to delays, both Deluxe and Elite cover the other core requirements, including hiking.

Given the customer's emphasis on comprehensive coverage, peace of mind, and flexible budget, the Elite tier is the most suitable choice. It provides significantly higher limits across all major categories compared to Deluxe, offering greater financial protection against potential issues like major medical emergencies or significant cancellation costs, which aligns better with the desire for comprehensive peace of mind. The No Mix-and-Match rule prevents taking the hiking cover from Deluxe/Elite and combining it with lower limits elsewhere. Therefore, Elite provides the best overall package despite the universal gap regarding pet accommodation costs.
