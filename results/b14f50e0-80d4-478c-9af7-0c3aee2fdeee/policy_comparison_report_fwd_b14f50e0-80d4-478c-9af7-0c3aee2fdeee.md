**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the customer's 3-week European trip: All tiers cover the core requirements like Medical, Cancellation, Luggage, and Delays, and allow the purchase of an optional 'Pet care' add-on for the specific pet accommodation cost requirement. Hiking (leisurely) is generally covered under standard policy terms across all tiers, assuming it's not professional or extreme.

However, the tiers differ significantly in coverage limits.
*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Medical Overseas, $7.5k Cancellation, $3k Luggage).
*   **Business:** Provides mid-range limits (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage).
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Cancellation, $7.5k Luggage, $1k Travel Delay).

The customer explicitly requested "comprehensive travel insurance" and stated a "flexible budget," prioritizing "peace of mind." Given the destination (Europe), duration (3 weeks), and these priorities, the significantly higher limits offered by the **First** tier align best with the customer's needs for robust protection against potentially high costs associated with medical emergencies, cancellations, or other disruptions overseas. While Business offers a good balance, First provides the most comprehensive coverage levels. The critical 'Pet Accommodation Costs' requirement necessitates purchasing the 'Pet care' add-on, which is available across all tiers and thus doesn't favour one base tier over another.

Therefore, the **First** tier is recommended as it provides the highest level of coverage across key areas, directly addressing the customer's desire for comprehensive protection and peace of mind, supported by their flexible budget.
