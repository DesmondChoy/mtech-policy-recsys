**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All tiers provide coverage for the core requirements including Medical, Trip Cancellation, Lost/Damaged Luggage, Travel Delays, and Hiking Activities. However, they differ significantly in their coverage limits.

*   **Classic:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $250k Medical, $5k Cancellation, $3k Luggage). While it covers hiking, the overall limits might not align with the customer's desire for "comprehensive coverage" and "peace of mind" for a 3-week trip to Europe.
*   **Deluxe:** Provides substantially higher limits than Classic (e.g., $500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage) and includes unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation for those under 70. This offers a good balance.
*   **Preferred:** Offers the highest limits across all key areas (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage) and also includes unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation (under 70).

The specific requirement for "Pet Accommodation Costs" due to return travel delay is not explicitly listed as a covered benefit in the provided details for *any* of the tiers. The Travel Delay benefit provides a cash payout ($100 per 6 hours in Preferred) which could potentially be used towards these costs, but it's not a direct reimbursement for that specific expense.

Given the customer's "Flexible budget", emphasis on "comprehensive coverage", and the destination (Europe for 3 weeks), the **Preferred** tier is recommended. It provides the highest benefit limits for medical emergencies, cancellations, and luggage issues, offering the greatest level of financial protection and "peace of mind". While the pet accommodation cost is not directly covered, the higher overall limits and comprehensive nature of the Preferred tier best meet the customer's stated priorities. The No Mix-and-Match rule prevents selecting lower tiers and adding specific coverages if not inherently included.
