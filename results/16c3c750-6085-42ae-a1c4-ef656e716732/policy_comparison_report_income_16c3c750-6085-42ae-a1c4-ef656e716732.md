**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All three tiers cover the basic requirements of medical expenses (excluding pre-existing conditions), standard trip cancellation, lost/damaged luggage, travel delays, and scuba diving (under adventurous activities with specific conditions like PADI certification/instructor supervision and depth limits). The primary difference lies in the coverage limits, which increase progressively from Classic to Deluxe to Preferred.

*   **Classic:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $250k Medical Overseas, $5k Cancellation, $3k Luggage).
*   **Deluxe:** Offers mid-range limits (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage).
*   **Preferred:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage).

Crucially, **none of these standard INCOME tiers (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred) provide coverage for pre-existing medical conditions**, such as the customer's high blood pressure. This is a significant gap as it directly contradicts a key requirement. Furthermore, trip cancellation coverage under standard policies typically applies only to specific unforeseen events (like serious illness, death of a close relative, natural disaster). Cancelling for a family wedding, especially one not yet scheduled, is **highly unlikely to be a covered reason under any of these standard tiers**.

Given these significant limitations common to all three tiers and the No Mix-and-Match rule (meaning pre-existing condition cover cannot be added separately to these standard plans), the choice must be based on which tier best addresses the *remaining* requirements. The customer expressed a desire for "proper coverage". The Preferred tier, with its significantly higher limits for general medical expenses, standard cancellation reasons, luggage loss/damage, and travel delays, aligns best with this desire compared to the Classic and Deluxe tiers.

Therefore, the **Preferred** tier is recommended as it provides the most comprehensive coverage levels for the aspects it *does* cover (general medical, standard cancellation, luggage, delay, scuba diving), despite failing to meet the critical requirements for pre-existing condition coverage and cancellation due to a family wedding. The customer MUST be made aware of these major exclusions.
