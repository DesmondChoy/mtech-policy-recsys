## Final Recommendation
Based on a detailed analysis of your requirements against available policies, the recommended policy is:

**GELS - Platinum**

### Justification
The GELS Platinum plan, combined with the mandatory purchase of its 'Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit', emerges as the single best overall policy for the customer when compared against Sompo Elite and FWD First.

1.  **Pre-existing Condition Coverage (High Blood Pressure):** This is a critical requirement. GELS Platinum (with add-on) offers the highest medical and evacuation limits for pre-existing conditions among the finalists (SGD 200,000 each for adults < 70, per Page 5, Section 38 a, c, d), surpassing FWD First's $150,000 limits (Page 9 & 24) and significantly better than Sompo Elite, which only covers evacuation/repatriation for pre-existing conditions ($150,000 limit, Page 3, Section 4) and likely excludes general medical treatment.

2.  **Trip Cancellation (Family Wedding):** While standard cancellation policies typically don't cover this, GELS Platinum includes a 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit (Page 4, Section 19). This offers partial coverage (up to SGD 6,000, likely 50% reimbursement based on the example on Page 6) for cancellation due to *any* reason, provided the policy is purchased within 30 days of the initial travel booking. FWD First offers a similar 'Cancel for any reason' add-on with the same limit ($6k @ 50%, Page 9 & 27), but requires purchase within a much stricter 7-day window from the initial deposit, making the GELS option more practical. Sompo Elite offers no coverage for this specific reason.

3.  **Scuba Diving Coverage:** GELS Platinum explicitly covers 'Adventurous leisure activities' including scuba diving (Page 5, Section 37), similar to Sompo Elite's 'Leisure Underwater Activities' (Page 5, Section 28). FWD First covers the activity risk under general medical/accident but lacks the explicit activity category mention found in GELS and Sompo.

4.  **Core Coverage & Simplicity:** GELS Platinum matches Sompo Elite with top-tier base limits for Medical ($1M), Cancellation ($15k), Luggage ($8k), and Travel Delay ($2k, with a shorter 4-hour trigger), slightly exceeding FWD First on luggage and delay limits. Crucially, GELS requires only *one* add-on purchase (for pre-existing conditions) compared to FWD First, which necessitates *two* separate add-ons (pre-existing conditions and cancel for any reason) to meet the customer's key needs.

**Trade-offs:** The GELS Platinum choice involves accepting co-payments for pre-existing condition claims (SGD 100 per outpatient visit, 50% for cancellation - Page 5, Section 38 & Footnote #) and the limitations of the 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit (purchase window, likely 50% reimbursement up to $6k). However, these trade-offs are outweighed by the superior pre-existing condition limits, explicit scuba coverage, excellent core benefits, and the more practical approach to the 'any reason' cancellation compared to the alternatives.

Therefore, GELS Platinum (with the necessary add-on) provides the most comprehensive and well-aligned coverage package for this customer's specific combination of requirements.
