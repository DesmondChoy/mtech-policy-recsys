**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the available SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a 2-week trip to Thailand:

1.  **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for travel to Japan and is therefore unsuitable for the customer's trip to Thailand.
2.  **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under the Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation section and generally does not cover them. Furthermore, it explicitly excludes cover for Leisure Underwater Activities (like scuba diving), failing to meet two critical customer requirements.
3.  **Deluxe vs. Elite:** Both Deluxe and Elite offer the core coverages requested (Medical, Cancellation, Luggage, Delay) and include specific cover for Leisure Underwater Activities (scuba diving) and some coverage for pre-existing conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation. However, Elite provides significantly higher coverage limits across the board:
    *   **Medical Expenses Overseas:** $1,000,000 (Elite) vs. $300,000 (Deluxe).
    *   **Pre-existing Condition Evacuation:** $150,000 (Elite) vs. $100,000 (Deluxe).
    *   **Leisure Underwater Activities Aggregate Limit:** $350,000 (Elite) vs. $250,000 (Deluxe).
    *   **Trip Cancellation:** $15,000 (Elite) vs. $6,000 (Deluxe).
    *   **Baggage Loss/Damage:** $8,000 (Elite) vs. $5,000 (Deluxe).
    *   **Travel Delay:** $2,000 (Elite) vs. $1,000 (Deluxe).

The customer emphasized needing "proper coverage," particularly for the pre-existing high blood pressure and scuba diving. While the specific request for trip cancellation due to a *potentially unplanned* family wedding is unlikely to be covered under standard "Insured Events" in any tier (as noted by the agent), the Elite tier offers the highest limits and most comprehensive coverage for the other specified needs. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. Elite provides the best overall package aligning with the customer's stated needs and desire for robust coverage, particularly concerning medical aspects and activities.

Therefore, the Elite tier is recommended as it provides the necessary coverage for scuba diving, includes coverage for pre-existing conditions under emergency evacuation (with higher limits than Deluxe), and offers substantially higher limits for all core requirements compared to Deluxe. Vital and GO Japan! are unsuitable.

    *   **Conditional Limits:** null

    *   *Note:* "Insured Events" typically include specific unforeseen circumstances like death, serious injury/illness of the insured or close relative, strike, natural disaster, etc. Cancellation due to choosing to attend a potentially unplanned wedding is generally not a standard covered reason.
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Not Met: Standard policy terms are unlikely to cover cancellation for this specific reason.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides the highest coverage limits among the suitable tiers for Medical Expenses, Trip Cancellation, Baggage, and Travel Delay.
    *   Includes specific coverage for Leisure Underwater Activities (Scuba Diving) with a high aggregate limit ($350,000).
    *   Offers coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation, with a higher limit ($150,000 for under 70s) compared to the Deluxe tier.
    *   Includes Amateur Sports Cover relevant to activities beyond scuba diving.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Coverage for Pre-existing Conditions (High Blood Pressure): While covered under Emergency Evacuation/Repatriation, general overseas medical treatment for the condition may be excluded under standard terms (requires verification from full policy wording). (Partially Met)
    *   Trip Cancellation for Family Wedding: This specific reason is highly unlikely to be covered under the standard "Insured Events" for trip cancellation. (Not Met)
