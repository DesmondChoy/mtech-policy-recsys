**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers require the purchase of the optional 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on to cover the customer's high blood pressure for medical events, cancellation, etc. The medical expense limit under this add-on varies significantly: Premium ($50k), Business ($100k), First ($150k). Similarly, all tiers require the optional 'Cancel for any reason' add-on to potentially cover cancellation due to a family wedding (as this is not a standard covered reason). This add-on provides 50% reimbursement up to a limit, which also varies: Premium ($1k), Business ($3k), First ($6k). The customer explicitly stated cancellation for the sister's wedding is the *most* important requirement.

The Premium tier offers the lowest limits for both critical add-ons, making it less suitable. The Business tier offers moderate limits ($100k pre-ex medical, $3k cancel for any reason). However, the First tier provides substantially higher limits for both the pre-existing condition medical coverage ($150k) and, crucially, the 'Cancel for any reason' benefit ($6k limit), offering much better protection for the customer's highest priority. While First is the most expensive, its superior limits for the customer's specific, high-priority needs (pre-existing condition and non-standard cancellation reason) make it the most suitable choice. The No Mix-and-Match rule prevents combining lower base tiers with higher add-on limits.

Therefore, the First tier is recommended as it offers the highest available coverage limits for the customer's most critical requirements (pre-existing condition medical needs and cancellation for any reason), alongside high base limits for general medical, luggage, and delays.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: First

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides the highest available limits for core coverage areas (Medical $1M, Cancellation $15k, Luggage $7.5k).
    *   Offers the highest limits for the crucial optional add-ons needed by the customer: Pre-existing medical conditions ($150k medical) and Cancel for any reason ($6k limit @ 50% reimbursement).
    *   Includes high limits for travel delay ($1k overseas) and unlimited emergency evacuation (base).
    *   Covers the activity risk of leisure scuba diving under standard benefits.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Requires the purchase of two separate optional add-ons ('Pre-existing medical conditions' and 'Cancel for any reason') to meet key requirements, increasing the overall cost.
    *   Trip Cancellation (Family Wedding): Coverage is only partial (50% reimbursement up to $6k limit) via the 'Cancel for any reason' add-on, which must be purchased within 7 days of the initial trip deposit.
    *   Scuba Diving: While the activity risk is covered, damage to owned diving equipment *while in use* is likely excluded under both standard baggage and the optional 'Sports equipment protector' add-on.
