**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the customer's golf trip to Australia: All tiers require the purchase of optional add-ons for 'Pre-existing medical conditions' cover (due to high blood pressure) and 'Sports equipment protector' cover (for golf clubs). However, a critical analysis reveals significant gaps across *all* tiers regarding the specific golf-related requirements:
1.  **Unused Green Fees Reimbursement:** Not offered by any tier.
2.  **Golf Buggy Damage Liability:** Not covered. Personal Liability explicitly excludes motorised vehicles in all tiers, and the included Car Rental Excess benefit (in First and Business, optional in Premium) applies only to licensed rental *cars*, not golf buggies.
3.  **Hole-in-One Benefit:** Not offered by any tier.
4.  **Golf Equipment Coverage:** While the optional 'Sports equipment protector' add-on (available for all tiers) covers golf clubs up to $2,000 against theft or damage (e.g., by airline), it explicitly *excludes* damage that occurs while the equipment is in use (practice or play). This fails to meet the customer's need for comprehensive protection during their golf activities.

Given these shared shortcomings in specific golf coverage and the No Mix-and-Match rule (meaning the customer must choose one tier with its available add-ons), the decision rests on which tier best provides the requested *comprehensive* core coverage (Medical, Cancellation, Baggage, Delay) and aligns with the customer's priority of value over lowest price.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Medical, $7.5k Cancellation, $3k Baggage).
*   **Business:** Offers mid-range limits (e.g., $500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $5k Baggage).
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $7.5k Baggage, $1k Travel Delay) and includes $1k Car Rental Excess cover.

Although it is the most expensive, the **First** tier provides significantly higher limits for core benefits, best matching the customer's requirement for "comprehensive coverage". While it fails to cover several specific golf requirements, this limitation is shared with the Premium and Business tiers. Therefore, First is recommended as the best available option from FWD, offering the most robust protection for general travel risks, even though the specific golf coverages requested are largely unmet by this insurer. The customer must be made aware of these specific gaps.
