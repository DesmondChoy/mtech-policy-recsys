**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the customer's 2-week trip to Japan: All tiers cover the core requirements of medical, baggage, travel delay, and standard trip cancellation (for reasons like illness/death). Hiking is considered a standard leisure activity and is covered under all tiers.

However, the critical requirement is trip cancellation coverage specifically for the sister's wedding. Standard cancellation clauses across all tiers do *not* cover this reason. This necessitates the optional 'Cancel for any reason' (CFAR) add-on, which is available for all three tiers but must be purchased within 7 days of the initial trip deposit and provides 50% reimbursement up to a specific limit.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits overall (e.g., $200k Medical Overseas, $7.5k Cancellation, $3k Baggage). Its CFAR add-on limit is only $1,000 (50% reimbursement). While it meets basic needs, the limits, especially for CFAR, may not align with the customer's desire for "comprehensive" coverage and specific cancellation concern.
*   **Business:** Provides a significant step up in coverage (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Cancellation, $5k Baggage). Crucially, its CFAR add-on limit is $3,000 (50% reimbursement). This offers a much better safety net for the wedding cancellation scenario and aligns well with the request for comprehensive protection.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Cancellation, $7.5k Baggage) and the highest CFAR limit of $6,000 (50% reimbursement). While the most comprehensive, the limits might exceed what's strictly necessary for two healthy adults on a 2-week trip, potentially leading to a higher premium than needed.

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. The Business tier strikes the best balance. It provides robust, comprehensive limits for the customer's main concerns (Medical, Baggage, Delay, standard Cancellation) and offers the essential CFAR add-on with a reasonable limit ($3,000) to address the specific wedding cancellation request, making it more suitable than Premium. While First offers higher limits, Business provides substantial coverage that should be sufficient, representing a better value proposition unless the non-refundable trip costs are exceptionally high (exceeding $6,000, where the $3k CFAR limit would be reached).

Therefore, the Business tier is recommended as it provides comprehensive coverage levels for the primary concerns and includes the necessary optional CFAR cover with a significantly better limit than Premium, offering the best overall fit for the customer's requirements without potentially over-insuring like the First tier might.
