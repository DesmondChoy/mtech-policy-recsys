**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) for the customer's 2-week trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier offers the lowest limits and, crucially, does not explicitly mention coverage for amateur sports like hiking (trekking), which is a stated requirement. Therefore, Vital is unsuitable.
*   **Deluxe:** Provides baseline coverage for all core requirements (Medical $300k, Baggage $5k, Delay $1k max, Cancellation $6k) and explicitly covers hiking up to 3,500m. It meets the basic needs.
*   **GO Japan!:** Specifically designed for travel to Japan, this tier offers significantly higher Overseas Medical Expenses coverage ($500k) than Deluxe, includes access to a cashless medical network in Japan (addressing the "access to a doctor" concern directly), and covers hiking. Its limits for Baggage ($5k), Travel Delay ($1k max), and Trip Cancellation ($6k) are the same as Deluxe.
*   **Elite:** Offers the highest limits across all categories (Medical $1M, Baggage $8k, Delay $2k max, Cancellation $15k) and covers hiking. However, it lacks the Japan-specific cashless medical network feature highlighted in the GO Japan! tier and is the most expensive option.

The customer requires comprehensive coverage, particularly for medical needs in Japan, baggage, delays, cancellation, and hiking. The specific request for trip cancellation due to a sister's wedding date clash is highly unlikely to be covered under standard "Insured Events" in *any* tier, as these typically require unforeseen circumstances like serious illness, death, natural disasters, etc. This specific request cannot be met by any standard policy.

Considering the remaining requirements and the No Mix-and-Match rule:
GO Japan! stands out as the most suitable tier. It provides a substantial medical limit ($500k) tailored to the destination, enhanced by a practical cashless service network within Japan, directly addressing the customer's medical concerns. It explicitly covers the required hiking activity. While Elite offers higher overall limits, the GO Japan! tier provides a strong, destination-specific package that balances comprehensive coverage (especially medical) with features directly relevant to the trip, likely at a more moderate price point than Elite. It offers a clear advantage over Deluxe due to the higher, destination-specific medical coverage.

Therefore, the **GO Japan!** tier is recommended as it provides the best holistic fit, balancing robust, destination-specific medical coverage and features with explicit hiking cover and adequate limits for other key concerns, representing a tailored and comprehensive solution for this specific trip to Japan.

    *   High Overseas Medical coverage ($500k) specifically for Japan.
