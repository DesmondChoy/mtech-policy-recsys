**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** This tier is unsuitable. While it covers core medical, baggage, delay, and standard cancellation, it explicitly *excludes* coverage for 'Adventurous leisure activities' (Page 5, Section 37), meaning the customer's planned hiking would not be covered. Furthermore, its standard trip cancellation (Section 16) only covers specific reasons (like illness, death, strike) which would not include cancelling for a sister's wedding. It lacks any 'cancel for any reason' benefit.
*   **Gold:** This tier provides comprehensive coverage that meets the customer's key requirements. It offers substantial medical cover (S$500k overseas), baggage loss (S$5k), travel delay (S$1.5k), and standard trip cancellation (S$10k). Crucially, it *includes* coverage for 'Adventurous leisure activities' (Page 5, Section 37), covering the planned hiking. It also includes a 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit (Page 4, Section 19a), which offers a potential (though partial) solution for the specific wedding cancellation concern (up to S$3k limit, typically 50% payout of non-refundable costs, requires purchase within 30 days of booking).
*   **Platinum:** This tier offers the highest limits across all categories (e.g., S$1M medical, S$8k baggage, S$15k cancellation) and faster delay payouts (4 hours vs 6 hours). It also covers hiking and includes the 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit with a higher limit (S$6k).

While Platinum offers higher limits, the Gold tier adequately covers all the customer's stated requirements, including the specific need for hiking coverage and providing the only available mechanism (shared with Platinum) to potentially cover cancellation due to the sister's wedding via the 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit. Given the customer has no pre-existing conditions and the Gold limits are already substantial, Gold represents the most suitable tier, providing a strong balance between comprehensive coverage for their specific needs and potentially unnecessary higher limits found in Platinum. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose a tier that covers *all* their needs; Basic fails on hiking and wedding cancellation, while both Gold and Platinum succeed, making Gold the most appropriate recommendation.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Gold

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides comprehensive coverage for core requirements: Medical (S$500k), Baggage (S$5k loss, S$1k delay), Travel Delay (S$1.5k), Standard Trip Cancellation (S$10k).
    *   Covers 'Adventurous leisure activities', meeting the specific requirement for hiking.
    *   Includes 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit, offering a potential (partial) solution for the specific wedding cancellation concern.
    *   No pre-existing conditions declared, so the standard coverage is applicable without needing the optional add-on.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip Cancellation Coverage: Cancellation due to the sister's wedding is not covered under standard reasons and only partially covered under the 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit (limited payout, subject to conditions like purchase timing).
    *   Baggage/Travel Delay: Payouts trigger after 6 hours, which is longer than the Platinum tier's 4 hours.
