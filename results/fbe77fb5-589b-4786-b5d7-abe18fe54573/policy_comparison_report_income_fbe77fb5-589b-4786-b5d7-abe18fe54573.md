**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All tiers cover the core requirements requested by the customer, including Medical, Luggage, Travel Delay, Trip Cancellation, and specific coverage for Hiking under their Adventurous Activities benefit (subject to standard conditions like altitude limits <4000m and safety compliance). The key differentiators are the coverage limits.

*   **Classic:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $250k Medical Overseas, $5k Cancellation, $3k Luggage). While it covers the basics, these limits might be considered less than "comprehensive" for a trip to Japan, especially the medical coverage.
*   **Deluxe:** Provides a significant step up in coverage compared to Classic (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas with Unlimited Evacuation for under 70s, $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage). This tier offers a strong balance between comprehensive coverage levels and likely cost.
*   **Preferred:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage). While providing the most coverage, it might exceed the customer's budget of "around $400" and the limits may be higher than necessary for their specific needs.

The customer's specific query regarding trip cancellation due to a family wedding rescheduling is not explicitly covered under standard perils in *any* of the tiers; this is a common exclusion. Therefore, this point does not differentiate the tiers.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must choose one complete tier) and the desire for "comprehensive" coverage balanced with a budget consideration, the **Deluxe** tier is recommended. It offers substantially better protection than the Classic tier, particularly for medical emergencies (including unlimited evacuation) and cancellation, providing a robust level of "comprehensive" cover without potentially reaching the higher cost and potentially excessive limits of the Preferred tier.
