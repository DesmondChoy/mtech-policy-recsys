**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:

*   **Basic Tier:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions (like the customer's high blood pressure), adventurous leisure activities (including hiking), and pet care (additional pet accommodation costs). These are all specific requirements for the customer.
*   **Gold Tier:** This tier covers adventurous leisure activities (hiking) and pet care directly. Crucially, it offers an *optional add-on benefit* for pre-existing conditions (PEC). With this add-on, the Gold tier can cover medical expenses ($150k limit for PEC), trip cancellation ($10k limit for PEC with 50% co-pay), and other related benefits arising from the customer's high blood pressure. It also meets the requirements for travel delay and lost/damaged luggage.
*   **Platinum Tier:** Similar to Gold, this tier covers adventurous activities and pet care, and also offers the optional PEC add-on benefit. It provides higher coverage limits than the Gold tier across most categories (e.g., $1M medical vs $500k, $200k PEC medical vs $150k, $15k cancellation vs $10k, $800 pet care vs $500) and a slightly better travel delay trigger (4 hours vs 6 hours).

**Selection Rationale:** Both the Gold and Platinum tiers, *when purchased with the mandatory Pre-existing Conditions add-on benefit*, can meet all the customer's core requirements, including comprehensive medical cover (with PEC), trip cancellation (with PEC), travel delay, luggage, hiking, and pet care. The Platinum tier offers higher limits, but the Gold tier provides substantial and suitable coverage levels for all specified needs (e.g., $500k base medical, $150k PEC medical, $10k cancellation, $5k luggage, hiking cover, $500 pet care). Since both tiers (with the add-on) are deemed suitable for meeting the stated requirements, the Tie-Breaking Rule is applied. As Gold appears before Platinum in the price ranking (Cheapest: Basic, Gold, Platinum), the Gold tier is selected.

Therefore, the Gold tier, *with the purchase of the Pre-existing Conditions add-on benefit*, is recommended as the most suitable and cost-effective option that meets all the customer's specified requirements.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Gold

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides coverage for all specific requirements when the Pre-existing Conditions (PEC) add-on is included: Comprehensive Medical (incl. PEC), Trip Cancellation (incl. PEC), Travel Delay, Luggage, Hiking, and Pet Care.
