**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All three tiers cover the core requirements of trip cancellation, travel delay, lost/damaged luggage, and medical expenses, albeit with varying limits. All tiers also explicitly cover hiking under their 'Adventurous Activities' benefit, subject to standard conditions (leisure activity, below 4,000m, safety compliance).

However, a critical requirement is coverage considering a pre-existing condition (high blood pressure). Based on the provided policy details for these standard plans, **none** of the tiers (Classic, Deluxe, or Preferred) cover pre-existing medical conditions (See Classic/Deluxe Page 5: "Standard plans do not cover pre-existing medical conditions"). This is a significant gap across all available options presented. Similarly, the specific request for coverage of additional pet accommodation costs due to travel delay is not explicitly addressed in any tier; the 'Travel delay' benefit provides a fixed cash sum per period of delay, not direct reimbursement for consequential losses like kennel fees.

Despite these shared gaps, the customer requested "comprehensive medical coverage". The Preferred tier offers the highest limits across key areas:
*   **Medical Expenses Overseas:** $1,000,000 (Preferred) vs $500,000 (Deluxe) vs $250,000 (Classic) for adults under 70.
*   **Trip Cancellation:** $15,000 (Preferred) vs $10,000 (Deluxe) vs $5,000 (Classic).
*   **Lost/Damaged Luggage:** $8,000 (Preferred) vs $5,000 (Deluxe) vs $3,000 (Classic).
*   **Emergency Medical Evacuation:** Unlimited (Preferred & Deluxe) vs $500,000 (Classic) for adults under 70.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must choose one complete tier), the Preferred tier is recommended. While it fails to meet the pre-existing condition and specific pet cost requirements (like the other tiers), its significantly higher limits, particularly for medical coverage, best align with the customer's desire for "comprehensive" protection and offer the most robust coverage for the other requested benefits among the available INCOME options. The customer must be advised about the lack of coverage for pre-existing conditions and the nature of the travel delay benefit regarding their pet costs.
