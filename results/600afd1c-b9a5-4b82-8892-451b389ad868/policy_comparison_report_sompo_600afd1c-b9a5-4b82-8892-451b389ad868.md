**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO tiers for the customer's trip to Australia:
*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable. It explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions under the Emergency Medical Evacuation benefit and does not include the required Amateur Sports Cover for hiking (trekking).
*   **GO Japan!:** While offering similar coverage levels to Deluxe for core benefits and including hiking/pre-existing evacuation, this tier is specifically tailored for travel to Japan (e.g., Japan-specific cashless network, hotline) and is therefore not the most appropriate choice for a trip to Australia.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier meets several core requirements. It includes Amateur Sports Cover (covering trekking up to 3,500m) and provides coverage for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions (up to $100k for under 70s). It covers medical expenses ($300k), trip cancellation ($6k), travel delay ($1k max), and luggage ($5k). However, the limits are lower than Elite.
*   **Elite:** This tier offers the most comprehensive coverage aligning best with the customer's needs. It includes the necessary Amateur Sports Cover for hiking (trekking up to 3,500m). Crucially, it provides the highest limit for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions ($150k for under 70s), better addressing the customer's specific concern about high blood pressure. Furthermore, it offers significantly higher overall limits: $1M for overseas medical expenses (aligning with "comprehensive medical coverage"), $15k for trip cancellation, $2k max for travel delay, and $8k for luggage.

While neither Deluxe nor Elite explicitly covers the requested "additional pet accommodation costs due to travel delay" (this is typically outside the scope of standard travel delay benefits which focus on the traveller's expenses), the Elite tier's substantially higher limits across all major categories, particularly medical and pre-existing condition evacuation, make it the most suitable choice given the customer's requirements for comprehensive cover and specific health concerns. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose the tier that best covers the *entire* set of needs, and Elite provides the strongest overall fit despite the pet accommodation gap.

Therefore, the Elite tier is recommended as it provides the highest level of coverage for the customer's key requirements, including comprehensive medical, trip cancellation, travel delay, luggage, specific cover for hiking, and the highest available limit for pre-existing condition emergency evacuation among the suitable tiers.

    *   Highest available limits for Overseas Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), and Baggage ($8k).
    *   Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation (standard conditions).
    *   Includes specific coverage for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions ($150k limit for under 70s).
    *   Includes Amateur Sports Cover, explicitly covering trekking up to 3,500m (meeting the hiking requirement).
    *   High maximum payout for Travel Delay ($2k).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Does not cover the specific request for additional pet accommodation costs resulting from a travel delay.
