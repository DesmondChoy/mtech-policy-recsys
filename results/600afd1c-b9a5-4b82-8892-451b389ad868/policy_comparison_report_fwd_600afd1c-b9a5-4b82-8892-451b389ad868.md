**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All three tiers offer the necessary optional add-ons to cover the customer's specific requirements for pre-existing medical conditions (high blood pressure) and pet care costs due to travel delay. Standard leisure hiking is also covered under all tiers as it's not typically excluded unless professional or involving specialized equipment.

However, the tiers differ significantly in their coverage limits. The customer explicitly requested "comprehensive medical coverage," which is particularly important given the pre-existing condition and travel to Australia.
*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest base medical cover ($200k overseas) and the lowest pre-existing condition medical limit ($50k). While it meets the basic requirements with add-ons, these limits might not be considered sufficiently "comprehensive".
*   **Business:** Provides a substantial increase in base medical cover ($500k overseas) and doubles the pre-existing condition medical limit ($100k) compared to Premium. It also offers higher limits for trip cancellation ($10k vs $7.5k), travel delay ($500 vs $300), and baggage ($5k vs $3k). This tier offers a much more robust level of protection, better aligning with the need for comprehensive coverage.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits overall ($1M medical, $150k pre-existing medical, $15k cancellation, etc.). While providing the maximum coverage, the significant step-up in protection offered by Business compared to Premium seems to strike a better balance for the customer's stated needs without potentially incurring the higher cost of the First tier.

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must choose one complete tier plus add-ons), the Business tier provides the most suitable package. It directly addresses the need for comprehensive medical coverage, including a reasonable limit for the pre-existing condition, and offers solid limits for other key requirements like cancellation, delay (including the pet care add-on), and luggage, making it the best overall fit compared to the lower limits of Premium and the potentially higher cost of First.
