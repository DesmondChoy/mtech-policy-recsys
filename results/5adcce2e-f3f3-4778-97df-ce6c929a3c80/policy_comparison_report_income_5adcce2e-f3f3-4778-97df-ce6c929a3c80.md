**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All three tiers cover core requirements like Medical Expenses Overseas, Trip Cancellation, Travel Delay, and Baggage Loss/Damage, but with significantly different limits. Classic offers the lowest limits (e.g., $250k Medical, $5k Cancellation), Deluxe offers mid-range limits (e.g., $500k Medical, $10k Cancellation), and Preferred offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation).

Crucially, none of the provided standard INCOME tiers (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred) explicitly cover pre-existing medical conditions like the customer's high blood pressure, as stated on Page 5 of each policy document ("Standard plans do not cover pre-existing medical conditions."). This is a major gap given the customer's specific concern. Furthermore, none of these tiers offer dedicated 'Golf Cover' addressing the specific requests for reimbursement of unused green fees, hole-in-one benefits, or explicit coverage for golf buggy liability (Personal Liability typically excludes vehicle operation, and Rental Vehicle Excess applies to cars). Golf equipment is covered under general baggage, but the $500 per item limit is the same across all tiers and may be insufficient for expensive clubs.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. Since the major gaps (pre-existing conditions, specific golf benefits) exist across *all* available standard tiers, the decision hinges on which tier best meets the remaining requirements, particularly the desire for "comprehensive" coverage. The Preferred tier provides the highest monetary limits for essential coverages like medical emergencies ($1M), trip cancellation ($15k), baggage loss ($8k), and travel delay ($2k).

Therefore, the **Preferred** tier is recommended. While it fails to cover the pre-existing condition and specific golf benefits (a limitation shared by the Classic and Deluxe tiers), it offers the most comprehensive protection for the core travel risks identified by the customer, aligning best with their request for high coverage levels among the available INCOME options. The significant gap regarding pre-existing conditions must be highlighted to the customer.
