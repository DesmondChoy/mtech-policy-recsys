**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for this customer's 10-day golf trip to Australia:

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits for key areas like Medical Expenses Overseas ($200k), Pre-existing Condition Medical add-on ($50k), and Trip Cancellation ($7.5k). While the cheapest, these limits may not meet the customer's need for "comprehensive" coverage, especially concerning the pre-existing high blood pressure.
*   **Business:** Provides a significant step up in coverage: Medical Expenses Overseas ($500k), Pre-existing Condition Medical add-on ($100k), and Trip Cancellation ($10k). It also includes Car Rental Excess cover ($500) in the base plan. This tier offers a strong balance between robust coverage for core concerns (medical, cancellation, pre-existing conditions) and cost.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits (Medical $1M, Pre-ex Medical $150k, Cancellation $15k, Car Rental Excess $1k). While providing the maximum coverage, it is also the most expensive.

**Crucially, none of the FWD tiers offer specific coverage for all the customer's golf-related requests:**
*   **Liability for Golf Buggy Damage:** All tiers exclude liability arising from the use of motorised vehicles under Personal Liability, which likely includes golf buggies.
*   **Reimbursement for Unused Golf Fees:** No tier explicitly covers reimbursement for unused green fees due to injury or adverse weather. Claims might be possible under Trip Disruption/Cancellation if a serious injury prevents play entirely, but specific coverage is lacking.
*   **Hole-in-One Benefit:** This benefit is not offered in any tier or add-on.
*   **Golf Equipment:** While the optional 'Sports Equipment Protector' add-on (available for all tiers with a $2k limit) covers theft/loss/damage to clubs *not* during use, it explicitly *excludes* damage that occurs *while playing*.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must choose one tier) and the fact that none of the tiers perfectly cover all the niche golf requirements, the decision focuses on the best fit for the core requirements (comprehensive medical, pre-existing condition, cancellation, delay, luggage).

The **Business** tier is recommended because it provides substantially higher limits than Premium for the customer's primary concerns (Medical, Pre-existing Condition, Cancellation), aligning better with the request for "comprehensive" coverage. It offers a good balance compared to the First tier, providing robust protection without the highest price tag, especially since the most specific golf requirements remain unmet even in the top tier. The necessary 'Pre-existing medical conditions' and 'Sports equipment protector' add-ons must be purchased with this tier.

Requires purchase of 'Sports equipment protector' add-on, which provides $2,000 coverage for golf clubs (theft, loss by carrier, accidental damage *not* during use).

        *   Detail Snippet: Excludes amounts refundable from other sources. (Source Location: Page 13 & 25)
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Not Met: There is no specific benefit covering unused green fees. While Trip Cut Short or Trip Disruption might cover *some* non-refundable costs if a serious injury forces trip abandonment or major itinerary change, it's not guaranteed to cover prepaid activity fees specifically, especially not for adverse weather unless it causes widespread disruption meeting policy definitions.

### Requirement: inquiry about hole-in-one benefits

    *   **Base Limits:** N/A
    *   **Conditional Limits:** N/A
