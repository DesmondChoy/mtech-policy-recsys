**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a 10-day trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation and does not cover amateur sports like hiking/trekking, failing two key requirements.
*   **Deluxe:** Covers hiking (trekking up to 3,500m) and provides a limited cover ($100k) for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions. However, general medical expenses for pre-existing conditions like asthma are likely excluded. Limits for cancellation ($6k) and luggage ($5k) are moderate.
*   **GO Japan!:** Specifically designed for Japan, offering higher overseas medical ($500k) than Deluxe and cashless services in Japan. It covers hiking and has the same $100k limit for pre-existing condition evacuation as Deluxe. Other limits (Cancellation $6k, Luggage $5k) are identical to Deluxe. General medical for asthma remains likely excluded.
*   **Elite:** Offers the highest coverage limits across all key areas: Medical ($1M Overseas), Cancellation ($15k), Luggage ($8k), and Travel Delay ($2k). It covers hiking (trekking up to 3,500m) and provides the highest available sub-limit for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions ($150k). While general medical expenses for asthma are still likely excluded (a common industry practice unless specified otherwise), this tier provides the most robust protection available within SOMPO for the evacuation aspect and overall higher financial safety nets for other concerns.

**Conclusion:** The customer requires coverage for hiking and has concerns about medical expenses related to asthma (pre-existing condition), trip cancellation (including a specific query), luggage, and delays. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, a single tier must be chosen. While no tier offers full coverage for general medical expenses related to asthma, Elite provides the highest limits for all other requirements and the highest available sub-limit for *emergency evacuation* related to pre-existing conditions. The significantly higher limits for medical, cancellation, luggage, and delay make Elite the most suitable choice to address the breadth and depth of the customer's concerns comprehensively, despite the likely exclusion for general asthma treatment and the wedding cancellation query. Therefore, the Elite tier is recommended.

### Requirement: Trip Cancellation

*   **Policy Coverage:** Trip Cancellation or Postponement
    *   **Base Limits:**
        *   Type: Per Insured Person, Limit: 15000, Basis: null
        *   Type: Per Family, Limit: 25000, Basis: null

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Provides a high limit ($15k) for cancellation due to standard insured events (e.g., serious illness/death of insured, travel companion, close relative). However, cancellation due to obligations related to a sister's wedding is highly unlikely to be a covered 'Insured Event' under standard policy terms, thus not meeting the specific additional request for clarification.
