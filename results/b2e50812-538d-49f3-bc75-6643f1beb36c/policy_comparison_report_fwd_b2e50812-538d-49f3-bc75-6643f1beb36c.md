**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers offer optional add-ons for 'Pre-existing medical conditions' (addressing the asthma) and 'Cancel for any reason' (potentially addressing the wedding cancellation query). However, the coverage limits differ significantly. Premium offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Overseas Medical, $50k Pre-existing Medical add-on, $1k Cancel for any reason add-on). Business offers mid-range limits (e.g., $500k Overseas Medical, $100k Pre-existing Medical add-on, $3k Cancel for any reason add-on). First provides the highest limits (e.g., $1M Overseas Medical, $150k Pre-existing Medical add-on, $6k Cancel for any reason add-on).

Given the customer's specific concern about asthma (a pre-existing condition) and the need for robust medical coverage, the higher limits under the First tier's pre-existing condition add-on ($150k vs $100k/$50k) are advantageous. Similarly, while the 'Cancel for any reason' add-on only provides 50% reimbursement and has conditions (like purchasing within 7 days of deposit), the First tier offers the highest potential reimbursement ($6k vs $3k/$1k) for this non-standard cancellation reason (sister's wedding obligation), offering the best available option for this specific request. The customer also expressed significant anxiety, suggesting higher overall limits for core benefits (Medical, Cancellation, Luggage, Delay) provided by the First tier would offer greater peace of mind.

Therefore, considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the First tier is recommended as it provides the most comprehensive coverage and highest limits, best addressing the customer's key requirements for pre-existing condition coverage, flexibility for cancellation reasons (via the add-on), and overall peace of mind, despite requiring the purchase of optional add-ons.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Standard cancellation is covered up to $15k for specified reasons. Cancellation due to the sister's wedding obligation is not a standard covered reason and would require purchasing the 'Cancel for any reason' optional add-on, which only provides 50% reimbursement up to $6k and must be bought within 7 days of the initial trip deposit.

### Requirement: Travel Delay

    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Person (Overseas Delay)', 'limit': 1000, 'basis': 'S$100 for every six hours delay while overseas'}, {'type': 'Per Person (Singapore Delay)', 'limit': 100, 'basis': 'S$100 for the first six hours delay in Singapore only'}]

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met: Assuming the hiking is leisure activity on marked trails (not professional, extreme, or mountaineering requiring ropes/guides, which are typically excluded under General Exclusions), injuries sustained during hiking would be covered under the standard Personal Accident, Medical Expenses, and Emergency Evacuation benefits.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: First

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Highest overall limits for core benefits (Medical $1M, Cancellation $15k, Luggage $7.5k).
    *   Highest available limits under the optional 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on ($150k Overseas Medical, $150k Evacuation), crucial for the asthma concern.
    *   Highest available limit under the optional 'Cancel for any reason' add-on ($6k at 50% reimbursement), providing the best possible coverage for the non-standard wedding cancellation query.
    *   Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation in the base plan.
    *   Includes Car Rental Excess cover ($1000).
    *   Likely covers leisure hiking under standard accident/medical benefits.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Medical Coverage (Asthma): Requires purchase of an optional add-on; coverage under this add-on has specific limits and co-payments apply to cancellation/disruption benefits.
    *   Trip Cancellation (Wedding): Not covered under standard terms. Requires purchase of 'Cancel for any reason' add-on, which only reimburses 50% of costs up to a limit ($6k) and must be bought within 7 days of the initial trip deposit. This provides only partial coverage for the specific concern.
