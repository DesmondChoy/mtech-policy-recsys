**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, and Elite tiers against the customer's requirements for a golfing trip to Japan:
*   **Vital:** Offers basic coverage but completely lacks any specific golf-related benefits (equipment, green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one) and does not explicitly cover amateur sports like golf. It fails to meet the core purpose of the customer's request.
*   **Deluxe:** Provides standard coverage and includes Amateur Sports cover (covering golf). It has a 'Golf Cover' section, but only covers Loss/Damage to Golf Equipment up to SGD 500. It explicitly states N.A. (Not Applicable) for unused green fees, hole-in-one, and damage to buggy, failing to meet these crucial requirements.
*   **GO Japan!:** While tailored for Japan with enhanced medical services (cashless network), its golf coverage is identical to the Deluxe tier: only SGD 500 for equipment loss/damage, with N.A. for unused green fees, hole-in-one, and buggy damage. It does not meet the specific golf activity requirements.
*   **Elite:** Offers the highest limits for standard coverage (Medical, Cancellation, Luggage, Delay). Crucially, it is the *only* tier with a comprehensive 'Golf Cover' section that addresses *all* the customer's specific requests: Loss/Damage to Golf Equipment (SGD 1000), Hole-in-one benefit (SGD 500), Unused Green Fees (SGD 250), and Damage to Buggy (SGD 500). It also includes Amateur Sports cover.

Given the customer's explicit and detailed requirements for various aspects of golf coverage, and the No Mix-and-Match rule preventing selection of benefits across tiers, the Elite tier is the only option that holistically meets all stated needs. While it is the most expensive, it provides the necessary comprehensive protection for the specific nature of the golfing trip.

Therefore, the Elite tier is recommended as it is the sole tier providing the specific, comprehensive golf coverage requested (equipment, green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one), alongside the highest limits for core requirements, aligning perfectly with the customer's stated priorities.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides comprehensive and specific coverage for all requested golf-related needs (equipment, unused green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one benefit) via the dedicated 'Golf Cover' section.
    *   Offers the highest coverage limits among the SOMPO tiers for core benefits like Medical Expenses (SGD 1M), Trip Cancellation (SGD 15k), and Lost/Damaged Luggage (SGD 8k).
    *   Includes Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for travellers up to 70 years old.
    *   Explicitly covers Amateur Sports, including golf.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   While coverage is provided, the specific limits within the 'Golf Cover' section (e.g., SGD 1000 for equipment, SGD 250 for green fees) might be lower than the customer's potential expenses, depending on equipment value or green fee costs. However, the requirement was for *coverage* which is met.
    *   This is the most expensive tier offered by SOMPO.
