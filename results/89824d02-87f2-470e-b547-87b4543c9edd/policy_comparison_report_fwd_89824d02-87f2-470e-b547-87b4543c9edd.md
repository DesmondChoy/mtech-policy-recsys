**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the customer's golfing trip to Japan: All tiers cover the core requirements of Medical Coverage, Trip Cancellation, Travel Delays, and Lost/Damaged Luggage, but with varying limits. Premium offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Medical Overseas, $7.5k Cancellation), Business offers mid-range limits (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Cancellation), and First offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Cancellation).

Crucially, the customer has specific golf-related requirements: Golf Equipment Coverage, reimbursement for unused green fees, cover for accidental damage to a golf buggy, and a hole-in-one benefit. Analysis reveals that **none** of the FWD tiers (Premium, Business, or First) explicitly cover unused green fees, accidental damage to a golf buggy (likely excluded under Personal Liability's vehicle exclusion and not covered by Car Rental Excess), or provide a hole-in-one benefit.

Coverage for Golf Equipment (loss/damage/theft, but *excluding* damage during use) is available under the **optional "Sports equipment protector" add-on**, which must be purchased separately. This add-on offers the *same* coverage limits ($2000 for equipment, $100/day for rental) regardless of whether it's added to the Premium, Business, or First tier.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule and the fact that the specific additional golf requirements (green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one) cannot be met by any FWD tier, the decision hinges on selecting the tier that best covers the core requirements and allows for the essential (though limited) optional Golf Equipment cover.

The Business tier is recommended because it provides a significantly better level of core coverage compared to the Premium tier (e.g., more than double the overseas medical limit, higher cancellation and luggage limits) and includes Car Rental Excess ($500 limit) as standard, offering a more robust safety net for the customer's "usual worries". While the First tier offers even higher limits, the Business tier strikes a better balance between comprehensive core coverage and cost, especially since the unique golf benefits sought are unavailable across all tiers. The essential optional "Sports equipment protector" can be added to the Business plan.

    *   **Conditional Limits:** [See Golf Equipment section above]
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [This add-on covers equipment loss/damage/theft and rental replacement only. It does not mention unused activity fees like green fees.] (Source Location: Page 28-29)

Rental car must be collected overseas. Requires copy of agreement, receipts for excess paid, related reports. (Source Location: Page 28)
        *   Detail Snippet: [Definition applies to 'rental car' from a 'licensed rental operator', unlikely to cover a golf buggy rented from a golf course.]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Not Met: Personal Liability explicitly excludes liability arising from the use of 'motorised vehicles', which likely includes golf buggies. Furthermore, it excludes damage to property in your care/custody (like a rented buggy). The included Car Rental Excess benefit applies specifically to rental *cars* from licensed rental agencies, not typically golf buggies rented from a course.

### Requirement: Coverage for a hole-in-one benefit
