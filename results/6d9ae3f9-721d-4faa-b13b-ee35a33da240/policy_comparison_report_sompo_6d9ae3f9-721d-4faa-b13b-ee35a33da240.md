**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) for the customer's 2-week trip to Europe:
*   **GO Japan!** is immediately excluded as it is specifically designed for travel to Japan, not Europe.
*   **Vital** offers the lowest limits for key coverages (e.g., $150k Medical, $3k Luggage, $5k Cancellation) and, critically, does not explicitly include cover for amateur sports like hiking/trekking up to 3,500m, which is a stated activity requirement. This makes it unsuitable.
*   **Deluxe** provides comprehensive coverage meeting all core requirements: Medical Expenses ($300k), Lost/Damaged Luggage ($5k), Travel Delays ($1k max), and Trip Cancellation ($6k). Importantly, it explicitly covers hiking/trekking up to 3,500m under its Amateur Sports Cover.
*   **Elite** offers the highest limits ($1M Medical, $8k Luggage, $15k Cancellation) and also covers hiking. While the higher limits are beneficial, especially for Europe, the Deluxe tier's limits are substantial and adequately meet the specified requirements without potentially exceeding the customer's implied budget preference (Deluxe is ranked cheaper than Elite).

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. Vital fails on the hiking requirement. Both Deluxe and Elite cover all requirements (except the specific wedding cancellation reason, which is unlikely covered by any standard policy). Deluxe provides a sufficient level of coverage for all stated needs, including the specific activity, at a lower price point than Elite. Therefore, Deluxe represents the most suitable and balanced option, meeting all specified coverage types and activities adequately. The specific request regarding cancellation for a sister's wedding is highly unlikely to be covered under the standard 'Insured Events' of any tier, including Deluxe.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Not Met: Standard trip cancellation policies cover specific unforeseen events (Insured Events like serious illness/death of traveller or close relative, natural disaster etc.). Cancelling a trip to attend a personal event like a sister's wedding is typically not listed as a covered 'Insured Event'.

    *   More budget-friendly than the Elite tier while still meeting all specified needs.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
