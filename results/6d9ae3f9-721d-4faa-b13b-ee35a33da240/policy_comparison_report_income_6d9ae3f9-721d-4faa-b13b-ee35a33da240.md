**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing INCOME's Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers for the customer's 2-week European trip for two travellers (age 26-40) requiring medical, luggage, delay, cancellation cover, and hiking cover:

*   **Classic:** Provides baseline coverage for all requested areas, including hiking. However, the limits are relatively low for a European trip (e.g., $250k Medical Expenses Overseas, $5k Trip Cancellation, $3k Baggage). While it meets the *types* of coverage, the *level* might be insufficient.
*   **Deluxe:** Offers a significant step-up in coverage limits compared to Classic (e.g., $500k Medical Expenses Overseas, $10k Trip Cancellation, $5k Baggage). It includes unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for travellers under 70 (which these customers are) and covers hiking under its Adventurous Activities benefit. This tier provides a robust level of protection suitable for European travel.
*   **Preferred:** Provides the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical Expenses Overseas, $15k Trip Cancellation, $8k Baggage) and also includes unlimited evacuation and hiking cover.

**Reasoning for Selection:** All tiers cover the basic requirements (Medical, Luggage, Delay, Cancellation, Hiking). The specific request regarding cancellation due to a sister's wedding is highly unlikely to be covered under any standard tier, as policies typically cover unforeseen events like serious illness, accidents, or natural disasters, not personal choices or events like weddings. This point applies equally to all tiers.

The Deluxe tier is recommended because it offers a substantial increase in key coverage limits compared to the Classic tier, particularly for Medical Expenses ($500k vs $250k) and includes the significant benefit of unlimited Medical Evacuation, making it much more suitable for travel to Europe. While the Preferred tier offers even higher monetary limits, the Deluxe tier already provides comprehensive coverage that strongly addresses the core requirements without potentially over-insuring at a higher cost. Therefore, Deluxe represents the best balance of robust coverage and value for this customer's needs, adhering to the No Mix-and-Match rule.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Deluxe

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides robust coverage for all core requirements: Medical Expenses (S$500k per person under 70), Lost/Damaged Luggage (S$5k per person), Travel Delays (S$1.5k per person), and Trip Cancellation (S$10k per person).
    *   Includes unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation and Repatriation for travellers under 70.
    *   Covers hiking as part of Adventurous Activities (subject to standard conditions like <4000m altitude).
    *   Offers significantly higher protection levels than the Classic tier, suitable for European travel.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip Cancellation: Does not cover cancellation for the specific reason requested (sister's wedding), as this is not typically considered an unforeseen event under standard policy terms.
