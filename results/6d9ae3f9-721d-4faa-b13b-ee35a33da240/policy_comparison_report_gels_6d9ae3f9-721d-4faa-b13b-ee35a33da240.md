**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** Covers core requirements like Medical Expenses (SGD 100k), Baggage Loss (SGD 2.5k), Travel Delay (SGD 500), and Trip Cancellation (SGD 2k). However, it explicitly **does not cover** "Adventurous leisure activities" (Section 37), which includes hiking, a specific customer requirement. It also lacks the "Travel inconvenience for any reason" benefit, meaning there's no coverage avenue for cancelling due to the sister's wedding.
*   **Gold:** Provides significantly higher limits for core requirements (Medical SGD 500k, Baggage Loss SGD 5k, Travel Delay SGD 1.5k, Trip Cancellation SGD 10k). Crucially, it **covers** "Adventurous leisure activities" (Section 37), meeting the hiking requirement. It also includes "Travel inconvenience for any reason" (Section 19), offering potential coverage (typically 50% of non-refundable costs up to SGD 3k, subject to conditions like purchase timing) if the customer needs to cancel for reasons not typically covered, such as the sister's wedding.
*   **Platinum:** Offers the highest limits (Medical SGD 1M, Baggage Loss SGD 8k, Travel Delay SGD 2k, Trip Cancellation SGD 15k) and also covers hiking and includes "Travel inconvenience for any reason" with higher limits (up to SGD 6k cancellation).

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the Basic tier is unsuitable due to the lack of hiking coverage. Both Gold and Platinum meet all stated requirements, including hiking and offering a potential (though limited) avenue for the wedding cancellation query via the "Travel inconvenience for any reason" benefit. Since both Gold and Platinum adequately meet the customer's needs, the Tie-Breaking Rule is applied. Gold appears before Platinum in the price ranking (Cheapest to Most Expensive: Basic, Gold, Platinum).

Therefore, the Gold tier is recommended as it fully meets all core requirements, covers the specified hiking activity, provides a potential solution for the wedding cancellation query via the 'any reason' benefit, and is the cheaper option compared to Platinum while still offering robust coverage limits suitable for a trip to Europe.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Gold

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides comprehensive coverage for all core requirements (Medical, Luggage, Delay, Cancellation) with high limits suitable for Europe.
    *   Explicitly covers hiking under "Adventurous leisure activities".
    *   Includes "Travel inconvenience for any reason" benefit, offering some flexibility for cancellation due to non-standard reasons like the sister's wedding (subject to conditions).
    *   Offers a good balance between coverage level and cost compared to Platinum.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Standard Trip Cancellation benefit does not cover cancellation due to sister's wedding.
    *   The "Travel inconvenience for any reason" benefit only provides partial (50%) reimbursement for cancellation, has a lower limit (SGD 3k) than standard cancellation, and is conditional on purchasing the policy within 30 days of the initial travel booking/deposit.
