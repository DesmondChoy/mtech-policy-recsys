**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the customer's 10-day trip to Australia with specific golf requirements:

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest coverage limits (e.g., $7.5k Trip Cancellation, $200k Overseas Medical). It requires optional add-ons for Pre-existing Conditions, Sports Equipment Protector, and Car Rental Excess. While it can cover the basics, the limits might not align with the customer's desire for "comprehensive" coverage, especially concerning the pre-existing condition.
*   **Business:** Provides mid-range limits (e.g., $10k Trip Cancellation, $500k Overseas Medical). It includes Car Rental Excess ($500) but still requires add-ons for Pre-existing Conditions and Sports Equipment Protector. The pre-existing condition medical limit is $100k. This is a balanced option but offers lower protection than First.
*   **First:** Offers the highest coverage limits (e.g., $15k Trip Cancellation, $1M Overseas Medical). It includes Car Rental Excess ($1000) and requires add-ons for Pre-existing Conditions and Sports Equipment Protector. The pre-existing condition medical limit is the highest at $150k, and evacuation is also covered up to $150k for pre-existing conditions.

**Key Considerations:**
1.  **Pre-existing Condition:** All tiers require the 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on. First provides the highest limits ($150k Medical, $150k Evacuation) for claims related to this, best matching the need for comprehensive medical cover.
2.  **Golf Coverage:** All tiers require the 'Sports equipment protector' add-on for specific equipment cover ($2000 limit). However, this add-on explicitly *excludes* damage occurring *during use* (practice or play). Standard baggage cover also excludes sports equipment. Therefore, while equipment loss/theft/damage *in transit* is covered with the add-on, damage during a game is not.
3.  **Specific Golf Requests:** None of the FWD tiers explicitly cover reimbursement for unused green fees due to course closure (e.g., weather), accidental damage to a rented golf buggy (likely excluded under Personal Liability or not covered by Car Rental Excess), or provide a hole-in-one benefit. These requirements cannot be met by any FWD tier.
4.  **No Mix-and-Match:** The customer must choose one tier. Since the specific golf requests (green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one) are unavailable across all tiers, the decision rests on the best coverage for the core requirements (Cancellation, Medical, Delay, Luggage, Equipment transit) and the pre-existing condition.
5.  **Customer Priority:** The customer emphasized comprehensive coverage over cost.

**Conclusion:** The First tier is recommended. Despite the higher price and the inability to meet all niche golf requests, it provides the highest limits across core benefits like Trip Cancellation, Medical Expenses (both base and pre-existing), Luggage, and Personal Liability. This best aligns with the customer's stated priority for comprehensive coverage and flexibility on budget, particularly given the pre-existing medical condition. The necessary 'Pre-existing medical conditions' and 'Sports equipment protector' add-ons must be purchased with this tier.
