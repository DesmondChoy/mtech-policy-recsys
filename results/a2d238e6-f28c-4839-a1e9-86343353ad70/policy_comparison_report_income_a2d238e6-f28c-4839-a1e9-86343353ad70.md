**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All tiers provide baseline coverage for Trip Cancellation, Medical Expenses, Travel Delay, and Lost/Damaged Luggage. However, they differ significantly in coverage limits and how they address the customer's specific golf-related needs.

*   **Classic:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $5k Cancellation, $250k Medical Overseas, $3k Luggage). It covers golf equipment under general baggage ($500/item limit) and potentially buggy damage via Personal Liability ($500k), but lacks any specific golf benefits like green fee reimbursement or hole-in-one cover.
*   **Deluxe:** Provides higher limits than Classic (e.g., $10k Cancellation, $500k Medical Overseas, $5k Luggage, $1M Personal Liability). Golf equipment cover remains under general baggage ($500/item), and specific golf benefits are still absent.
*   **Preferred:** Offers the highest limits across all core areas (e.g., $15k Cancellation, $1M Medical Overseas for under 70s, $8k Luggage, $1M Personal Liability). While it *also* lacks explicit coverage for unused green fees and hole-in-one benefits, and covers golf equipment under the standard $500/item baggage limit, its significantly higher overall limits align best with the customer's request for "comprehensive" coverage and stated budget flexibility. The higher Personal Liability limit offers better protection for potential golf buggy damage.

Crucially, none of the provided standard INCOME tiers (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred) cover pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure, which is a significant gap given the customer's requirements. Furthermore, none specifically cover unused green fees due to course closure or offer a hole-in-one benefit.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule and the limitations across all tiers regarding specific golf benefits, the **Preferred** tier is recommended. It provides the most robust protection for the core requirements (Medical, Cancellation, Luggage, Liability) due to its superior coverage limits, which best reflects the customer's desire for comprehensive peace of mind, despite the noted gaps in specific golf features and pre-existing condition coverage inherent in these standard plans.
