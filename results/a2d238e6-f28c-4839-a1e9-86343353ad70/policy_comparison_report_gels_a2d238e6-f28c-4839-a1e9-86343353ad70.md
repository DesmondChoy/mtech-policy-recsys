**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic Tier:** This tier is unsuitable. It completely lacks coverage for pre-existing conditions (like the customer's high blood pressure), which is a critical requirement. Furthermore, it offers no specific "Golfer's cover", failing to meet any of the customer's golf-related needs (equipment, green fees, hole-in-one) and lacks rental vehicle excess cover for the buggy damage concern.
*   **Gold Tier:** This tier covers the core requirements (Trip Cancellation, Medical, Delay, Luggage) and includes "Golfer's cover" addressing equipment loss ($500), unused green fees ($250 - *but only for injury/illness*), and hole-in-one ($250). It also covers rental vehicle excess ($1000) for the buggy. Crucially, it offers an *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions, which is necessary for the customer.
*   **Platinum Tier:** This tier provides the highest limits for core coverage (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Trip Cancellation, $8k Luggage). It includes the same "Golfer's cover" benefits as Gold but with a higher limit for equipment ($1000) and adds separate "Sports equipment cover" ($1000). It also has a higher rental vehicle excess limit ($1500) and a better travel delay trigger (payout after 4 hours vs. 6 hours for Gold). Like Gold, it requires the purchase of the *optional add-on* to cover pre-existing conditions.

**Reasoning for Recommendation:**
Both Gold and Platinum can meet the customer's requirements *if the pre-existing condition add-on is purchased*. The Basic tier is eliminated. Between Gold and Platinum, Platinum offers significantly higher coverage limits across almost all relevant categories (Medical, Cancellation, Luggage, Golf Equipment, Rental Vehicle Excess) and a superior travel delay benefit. Given the customer stated that "Good coverage is more important than saving a few dollars" and requires comprehensive protection, the Platinum tier aligns best with this priority. Although both Gold and Platinum have the same limitation regarding the reason for unused green fee reimbursement (injury/illness vs. course closure), Platinum's overall higher protection levels make it the most suitable choice based on the customer's stated preference for robust coverage. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose one tier, and Platinum provides the best overall package despite the green fee caveat.
