**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it lacks specific coverage for Amateur Sports, failing the customer's explicit requirement for Hiking cover. Its coverage limits for Medical ($150k), Cancellation ($5k), and Baggage ($3k) are also the lowest and may not meet the customer's desire for "comprehensive" protection.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier meets the core requirements, including Hiking cover (trekking up to 3,500m). It offers moderate limits (Medical $300k, Cancellation $6k, Baggage $5k). However, it does not offer the highest level of coverage available.
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically tailored for Japan trips, offering higher overseas medical cover ($500k) than Deluxe and Japan-specific cashless medical services. It also covers Hiking (trekking up to 3,500m). Its Cancellation ($6k) and Baggage ($5k) limits are the same as Deluxe. While relevant to the destination, its core limits are lower than Elite.
*   **Elite:** This tier provides the highest coverage limits across key areas (Medical $1M, Cancellation $15k, Baggage $8k) and includes the required Hiking cover (trekking up to 3,500m).

**Crucially, none of the available SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) explicitly mention the requested "Accidental Death Double Indemnity on public transport" benefit based on the provided policy data.**

Given the customer's flexible budget and emphasis on "comprehensive" and "proper" coverage, the Elite tier is the most suitable choice. Although it cannot meet the specific Double Indemnity requirement (which no tier meets), it offers significantly higher financial protection for Medical emergencies, Trip Cancellation, and Luggage loss compared to Deluxe and GO Japan!, best aligning with the customer's stated priority for robust coverage over cost savings. The No Mix-and-Match rule means selecting a single tier, and Elite provides the best overall package for the requirements that *can* be met.
