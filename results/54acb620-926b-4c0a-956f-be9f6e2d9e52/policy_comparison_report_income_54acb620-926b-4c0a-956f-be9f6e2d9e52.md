**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All tiers cover core requirements like Medical Expenses, Trip Cancellation, Lost/Damaged Luggage, Travel Delays, and Hiking (under Adventurous Activities, below 4,000m). However, a key customer requirement is the "Accidental Death Double Indemnity" specifically for incidents on public transport.

*   The **Classic** tier explicitly states "NA" (Not Available) for the Public transport double cover under Personal Accident (Section 13), failing to meet this mandatory requirement. Therefore, Classic is unsuitable.
*   The **Deluxe** tier meets all requirements, including the Double Indemnity ($400,000 limit for adults under 70). It offers good coverage levels ($500k Medical Overseas, $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage).
*   The **Preferred** tier also meets all requirements, including Double Indemnity, but offers significantly higher limits ($1,000,000 limit for adults under 70). It provides the highest coverage levels across all key areas ($1M Medical Overseas, $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage, Unlimited Evacuation/Repatriation for under 70s).

Given the customer's stated flexible budget and prioritization of "comprehensive" and "proper cover" over cost savings, and the No Mix-and-Match rule preventing combining features, the Preferred tier is the most suitable. While Deluxe meets the minimum requirements, Preferred aligns better with the customer's desire for the most robust protection available, offering substantially higher limits, particularly for medical expenses and the requested double indemnity benefit.
