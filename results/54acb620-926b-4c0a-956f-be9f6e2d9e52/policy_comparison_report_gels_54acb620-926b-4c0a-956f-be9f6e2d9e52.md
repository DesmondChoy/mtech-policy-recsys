**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers: The Basic tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for "Public transport double indemnity" and "Adventurous leisure activities", failing to meet two specific customer requirements (double payout for accidental death on public transport and coverage for hiking).

Both the Gold and Platinum tiers meet all the customer's requirements, including comprehensive medical coverage, trip cancellation, lost/damaged luggage, travel delays, coverage for adventurous leisure activities (which includes hiking), and public transport double indemnity. The Platinum tier offers higher coverage limits across most benefits compared to the Gold tier.

However, the customer stated their budget was flexible but prioritized meeting *all* requirements rather than necessarily seeking the absolute maximum coverage available. Since both the Gold and Platinum tiers fully satisfy all stated requirements, they are considered equally suitable in terms of meeting the core needs. Applying the Tie-Breaking Rule, which dictates selecting the cheapest among equally suitable options based on the provided price ranking (Basic < Gold < Platinum), the Gold tier is recommended.
