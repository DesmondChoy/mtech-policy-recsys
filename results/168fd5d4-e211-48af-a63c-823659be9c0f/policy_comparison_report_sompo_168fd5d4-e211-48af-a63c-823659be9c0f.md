**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against Mr. Tan's requirements reveals significant differences. The **Vital** tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation and does not include specific cover for amateur sports like hiking. The **Deluxe** and **GO Japan!** tiers offer improvements, including Amateur Sports Cover (covering hiking up to 3,500m) and limited coverage ($100k) for pre-existing conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation. GO Japan! offers higher overseas medical limits ($500k vs Deluxe's $300k) and Japan-specific cashless services, but has a lower baggage delay payout rate than Deluxe. However, both Deluxe and GO Japan! have lower overall limits compared to Elite and the pre-existing condition coverage for general medical emergencies remains a concern.

The **Elite** tier provides the most comprehensive coverage aligning best with the customer's needs, despite likely exceeding the preferred budget and failing to meet one specific request. It offers the highest limits across key areas: $1,000,000 for Overseas Medical Expenses, $15,000 for Trip Cancellation, $8,000 for Baggage Loss, and $500,000 for Personal Accident. Crucially, it includes Amateur Sports Cover for hiking and provides the highest available limit ($150,000) for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions, offering the best available (though not unlimited) assurance for the high blood pressure concern within SOMPO's options. It also has a high Baggage Delay payout rate for essentials.

A key requirement, the "double payout for accidental death while using public transport," is **not mentioned as a feature in any of the provided SOMPO tier details (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite)**. Therefore, this specific requirement cannot be met by any available SOMPO tier based on the provided data.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must choose one complete tier) and the customer's statement that "coverage has to be right" potentially overriding the budget preference, the Elite tier is recommended. It most closely matches the desire for "comprehensive" coverage, provides the highest available protection for the pre-existing condition evacuation scenario, explicitly covers hiking, and offers superior limits for cancellation, luggage, and general medical needs compared to the other tiers.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met: Hiking (trekking up to 3,500m) is explicitly included under the Amateur Sports Cover.

### Requirement: Pre-existing Conditions (High blood pressure assurance in emergencies)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation (Including Mortal Remains) Back to Singapore
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person - up to 70 years', 'limit': 'Unlimited', 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - above 70 years', 'limit': 150000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - up to 70 years (Pre-existing Conditions)', 'limit': 150000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - above 70 years (Pre-existing Conditions)', 'limit': 75000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 'No aggregate limit', 'basis': None}]

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: While Emergency Evacuation/Repatriation due to pre-existing conditions is covered up to a limit ($150,000 for under 70s), this does not guarantee full coverage for all emergency *medical expenses* arising from the high blood pressure. Standard travel insurance policies often exclude or limit general medical treatment for pre-existing conditions, even in emergencies, unless it's a life-threatening situation covered under specific clauses (not detailed here). The customer's request for assurance it "won't be used against them" is not fully met by standard policy terms, although Elite offers the highest available sub-limit for evacuation among the tiers.

### Requirement: Coverage for essentials if luggage is delayed

*   **Policy Coverage:** Baggage Delay
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person', 'limit': 125, 'basis': '$200 for 1st full 6 hours (overseas) or $150 for 1st full 6 hours (Singapore), $125 per full 4 hours thereafter (overseas)'}, {'type': 'Maximum Limit', 'limit': 1000, 'basis': None}]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Pays a cash benefit for delay in arrival of checked-in baggage for specified durations. Extended to cover delay if baggage is wrongly picked up by another passenger overseas.', 'source_location': 'Page 4, Section 18'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met: The cash benefit provided is intended for purchasing essential items during the delay.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Highest overall coverage limits (Medical $1M, Cancellation $15k, Baggage $8k, AD $500k).
    *   Explicitly covers Hiking under Amateur Sports Cover.
    *   Provides the highest available sub-limit ($150k) for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to Pre-existing Conditions among the SOMPO tiers.
    *   Comprehensive range of benefits including high limits for travel/baggage delays and disruption.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Accidental Death Coverage (double payout public transport): Requirement Not Met as this feature is not mentioned in the provided policy data for any tier.
    *   Pre-existing Conditions (High blood pressure assurance in emergencies): Requirement Partially Met. While evacuation has a sub-limit, general medical expenses arising from PEC are likely excluded or limited, not providing the full assurance requested.
    *   Price: Likely exceeds the customer's preferred budget of $200-$300.
