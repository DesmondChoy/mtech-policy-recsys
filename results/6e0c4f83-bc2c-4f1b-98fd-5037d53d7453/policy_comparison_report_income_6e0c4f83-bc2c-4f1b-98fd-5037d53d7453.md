**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All three tiers provide coverage for the core requirements including Medical Expenses, Luggage Loss/Delay, Travel Delay, Trip Cancellation, and Scuba Diving (under Adventurous Activities with specific conditions). However, they differ significantly in their coverage limits.

*   **Classic:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $250k Medical Overseas, $5k Trip Cancellation, $3k Luggage Loss). While it covers the types of events requested, the limits may not meet the customer's need for "robust" and "comprehensive" coverage.
*   **Deluxe:** Provides higher limits than Classic (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Trip Cancellation, $5k Luggage Loss), offering a better level of protection.
*   **Preferred:** Offers the highest limits across all key areas (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Trip Cancellation, $8k Luggage Loss, Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for under 70s).

The customer explicitly requested "robust medical coverage" and "comprehensive travel insurance", stating that budget was flexible and coverage was the priority. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (meaning the customer must select one complete tier), the Preferred tier best aligns with these requirements by providing the highest available limits and most extensive coverage offered by INCOME for this policy type. The significantly higher medical, cancellation, and luggage limits, along with unlimited evacuation, directly address the desire for robust protection. While the specific request for pet accommodation coverage due to return delay is not met by any tier, the Preferred tier offers the strongest overall package for the other stated needs.

Therefore, the Preferred tier is recommended as it provides the most comprehensive coverage and highest limits, directly matching the customer's stated priority for robust protection over cost.
