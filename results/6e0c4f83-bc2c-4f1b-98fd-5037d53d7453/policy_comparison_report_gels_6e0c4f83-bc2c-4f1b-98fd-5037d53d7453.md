**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** Fails to meet key requirements. It explicitly excludes coverage for 'Adventurous leisure activities' (Section 37), meaning Scuba Diving is not covered. It also lacks the 'Pet care' benefit (Section 30) requested by the customer for potential return travel delays.
*   **Gold:** Meets the minimum requirements. It includes coverage for 'Adventurous leisure activities' (Section 37), covering Scuba Diving, and provides a 'Pet care' benefit (Section 30, $500 limit). It offers substantial medical ($500k), baggage ($5k), and cancellation ($10k) limits. However, the travel/baggage delay trigger is 6 hours.
*   **Platinum:** Meets all requirements and offers significantly higher ("robust") coverage levels, aligning better with the customer's priority and flexible budget. It covers 'Adventurous leisure activities' (Section 37) including Scuba Diving, and has a higher 'Pet care' limit (Section 30, $800). Medical coverage ($1M), baggage ($8k), and cancellation ($15k) limits are much higher than Gold. Crucially, the travel and baggage delay trigger is shorter (4 hours vs 6 hours for Gold), offering quicker access to benefits. It also includes 'Sports equipment cover' (Section 33), which could be relevant although not explicitly requested.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. While Gold meets the basic criteria, the Platinum tier provides a demonstrably higher level of protection across all requested areas (medical, luggage, cancellation, pet care) and features like a shorter delay trigger, better reflecting the customer's desire for "robust" coverage and flexible budget. Therefore, Platinum is the single most suitable tier.
