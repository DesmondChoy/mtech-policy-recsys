**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a trip to Thailand:
*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes Leisure Underwater Activities (Section 28 N.A.) and does not mention Amateur Sports Cover, failing the mandatory Scuba Diving requirement. Its medical ($150k) and cancellation ($5k) limits are also significantly lower.
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for travel to Japan and is therefore inappropriate for the customer's trip to Thailand.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier meets the core requirements, including Scuba Diving cover under Leisure Underwater Activities (Section 28, $250k aggregate limit). It offers reasonable limits ($300k Medical, $6k Cancellation).
*   **Elite:** This tier also meets all core requirements, including Scuba Diving cover under Leisure Underwater Activities (Section 28, higher $350k aggregate limit). It provides substantially higher coverage limits across key areas compared to Deluxe ($1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $8k Baggage).

The customer requested "robust" medical coverage and "comprehensive" insurance, stating their budget was "flexible". While both Deluxe and Elite cover Scuba Diving, the Elite tier's significantly higher limits align better with the customer's desire for robust and comprehensive protection. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, selecting a single tier is necessary. Elite provides the most comprehensive package available among the suitable options. The specific request regarding pet accommodation fees due to return travel delay is not explicitly covered under the Travel Delay cash benefit structure in any tier; this benefit provides a fixed cash amount per delay period, not reimbursement for specific consequential costs like kennel fees.

Therefore, the **Elite** tier is recommended as it fully meets all primary coverage requirements, including the crucial Scuba Diving activity, and offers the highest limits that best match the customer's stated need for robust and comprehensive coverage with a flexible budget.
