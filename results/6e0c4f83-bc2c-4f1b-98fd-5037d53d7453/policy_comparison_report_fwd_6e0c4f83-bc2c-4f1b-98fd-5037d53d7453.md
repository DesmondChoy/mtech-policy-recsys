**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers cover the core requirements like Medical, Luggage, Travel Delay, and Trip Cancellation, and likely cover recreational scuba diving under standard medical/accident benefits (subject to policy terms like PADI certification, licensed operators, depth limits). However, they differ significantly in coverage limits. Premium offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Medical, $7.5k Cancellation, $3k Luggage), which may not meet the customer's need for "robust" and "comprehensive" coverage. Business provides higher limits ($500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage) and includes Car Rental Excess cover. First offers the highest limits across all key areas ($1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $7.5k Luggage, $1k Travel Delay, $900 Baggage Delay) and also includes higher Car Rental Excess cover ($1k).

The customer explicitly requested "robust medical coverage" and "comprehensive travel insurance," stating that budget was flexible and coverage was the priority. While Business offers good coverage, the First tier provides substantially higher limits, particularly for medical expenses ($1M vs $500k) and trip cancellation ($15k vs $10k), aligning better with the desire for robust protection. The specific request regarding pet accommodation requires the purchase of the optional 'Pet Care' add-on, which is available for all tiers but must be added separately; this does not differentiate the tiers themselves.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must choose one complete tier) and the emphasis on comprehensive, robust coverage with a flexible budget, the First tier is recommended as it provides the highest level of protection among the available options for the core requirements identified by the customer.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: The policy provides cash benefits for delays ($100 per 6 hours) rather than explicitly covering accommodation and meal costs. The cash benefit can be used for these purposes, but may not cover the full expense depending on the location and situation. Minimum delay trigger is 6 hours. Missed connections are covered with a cash benefit.

### Requirement: Trip Cancellation

Covers additional transport/accommodation (economy/standard) needed due to insolvency.', 'source_location': 'Page 12, What we pay'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Definition of insolvency provided (unable to pay debts, ceased operations due to declared insolvency, owner convictions/investigation for fraud/dishonesty, owner absconded).', 'source_location': 'Page 12, Meaning of insolvency'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Excludes claims if policy purchased less than 72 hours before scheduled departure. Excludes refunds/compensation already received.', 'source_location': 'Page 12, What is not covered'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met: Covers cancellation for various unforeseen events including illness/injury, natural disasters affecting travel (via serious public event preventing travel), and travel provider insolvency, up to high limits.

### Requirement: Scuba Diving Coverage

*   **Policy Coverage:** Medical expenses incurred overseas
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Adult below 70 years of age', 'limit': 1000000, 'basis': None}, ...]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** [...]

    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Pays a lump sum if you suffer an accident during the trip that causes death or total and permanent disability (TPD) within 90 days.', 'source_location': 'Page 18, Personal accident'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met: Standard FWD policies typically cover medical expenses and personal accidents arising from participation in recreational activities like scuba diving, provided it is done within certified limits and with licensed operators, and not specifically excluded under General Exclusions (which usually exclude professional or extreme sports, not standard recreational diving). The high medical and unlimited evacuation limits provide robust cover. Note: This assumes standard recreational scuba diving is covered; specific policy wording should be checked for depth/certification limits or exclusions. The optional 'Sports Equipment Protector' covers the gear itself, not the activity liability/medical needs.

### Requirement: Check if additional pet accommodation fees incurred in Singapore due to a covered return travel delay are claimable.

*   **Policy Coverage:** Pet care
    *   **Base Limits:** []
    *   **Conditional Limits:** [{'condition': 'Optional Cover Purchased', 'limits': [{'type': 'Overall limit', 'limit': 150, 'basis': 'S$50 for every six hours of delay'}], 'source_location': 'Page 9, Optional Covers'}]
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Optional cover. Payable if your scheduled public transport returning to Singapore is delayed for 6 continuous hours or more. You, your family member, or travel companion must not be the cause of delay. Your pet must be staying in a pet hotel or kennel during your trip.', 'source_location': 'Page 28, Pet care'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Benefit paid S$50 for each 6-hour period you are delayed in reaching Singapore. Delay calculated between original scheduled arrival and actual arrival time.', 'source_location': 'Page 28, What we pay'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Coverage is available, but only via a separate, optional 'Pet Care' add-on that must be purchased in addition to the base First tier policy. The base policy's Travel Delay benefit does not cover this specific cost. The add-on provides $50 per 6 hours delay, capped at $150.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: First

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides the highest ("robust") limits for key requirements: Medical ($1M), Evacuation (Unlimited), Trip Cancellation ($15k), Luggage ($7.5k), Travel Delay ($1k).
    *   Covers trip cancellation due to specified unforeseen events, including provider insolvency.
    *   Includes coverage for recreational scuba diving under standard medical/accident benefits (subject to terms).
    *   Offers high baggage delay cash benefits ($150 per 6 hours overseas, up to $900).
    *   Includes Car Rental Excess cover ($1000).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Travel Delay benefit is a cash payment ($100 per 6 hours), which may not fully cover actual accommodation/meal costs during a significant delay.
    *   Coverage for additional pet accommodation costs due to return delay is *not* included in the base tier; it requires purchasing the optional 'Pet Care' add-on.
    *   Standard exclusions apply (e.g., specific reasons for trip disruption, depreciation on luggage claims).
