**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the customer's trip to Australia, focusing on core travel needs and specific golfing requirements:

*   **Core Coverage (Cancellation, Medical, Luggage, Delays):** All three tiers provide these essential coverages, but with varying limits. Premium offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Medical Overseas), Business offers mid-range limits (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas), and First provides the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Cancellation).
*   **Hiking:** Standard leisure hiking is generally covered under the scope of travel insurance unless specifically excluded as a high-risk activity, which is not indicated for basic hiking in these policies. All tiers should cover this.
*   **Specific Golf Requirements:** This is where the significant gap lies across *all* FWD tiers based on the provided data.
    *   **Golf Equipment:** Coverage is *not* included as standard in any tier. It requires purchasing the *optional* 'Sports equipment protector' add-on, which is available for all three tiers with a $2,000 limit. Notably, this add-on excludes damage that occurs while the equipment is in use (practice or play).
    *   **Unused Green Fees:** This benefit is not mentioned or covered in any of the tiers or the optional add-ons.
    *   **Accidental Damage to Golf Buggy:** This is not explicitly covered. The Personal Liability benefit in all tiers excludes liability arising from the use of motorised vehicles. While Business and First include Car Rental Excess cover (optional for Premium), this typically applies to licensed rental cars and is unlikely to extend to golf buggies unless specifically defined in a rental agreement that meets the policy terms.
    *   **Hole-in-One Benefit:** This benefit is not mentioned or covered in any of the tiers or optional add-ons.

**Conclusion:**

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. Since none of the FWD tiers fully satisfy the specific golfing requirements beyond equipment (which requires an add-on), the choice rests on the best coverage for the remaining requirements, considering the customer's flexible budget. The First tier offers substantially higher limits for crucial coverages like Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), and Baggage ($7.5k) compared to the Business and Premium tiers. While it fails to meet several specific golf needs (a weakness shared by all FWD tiers here), it provides the most robust protection for the core travel risks and allows the addition of the 'Sports equipment protector' for the clubs. Therefore, the **First** tier is recommended as the best available option within FWD, providing the highest overall protection level for the covered risks, aligning with the flexible budget, despite the noted gaps in specific golf coverage.
