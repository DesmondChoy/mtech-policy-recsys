**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, and Elite tiers against the customer's requirements for a golfing trip to Australia:
*   **Vital:** This tier lacks specific coverage for amateur sports like hiking and offers no specific Golf Cover benefits (Section 36 is not applicable). It fails to meet key activity-related requirements.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier includes Amateur Sports Cover (covering hiking) and basic Golf Equipment loss/damage ($500 limit). However, under its Golf Cover (Section 36), it explicitly states "N.A." (Not Applicable) for Hole-in-One, Unused Green Fees, and Damage of Buggy. It therefore fails to meet three out of the four specific golf requirements prioritized by the customer.
*   **GO Japan!:** Although offering higher medical limits than Deluxe, this tier is primarily designed for Japan. Crucially, its Golf Cover (Section 36) mirrors the Deluxe tier, covering only equipment loss/damage ($500) and listing "N.A." for Hole-in-One, Unused Green Fees, and Damage of Buggy. It also fails on the specific golf requirements.
*   **Elite:** This tier includes Amateur Sports Cover (covering hiking). Most importantly, it is the *only* tier with a comprehensive Golf Cover section (Section 36) that provides specific limits for *all* the customer's requested golf benefits: Loss or damage of golf equipment ($1000), Hole-in-one ($500), Unused green fees ($250), and Damage of buggy ($500). Additionally, it offers the highest coverage limits across core areas like Trip Cancellation ($15,000) and Medical Expenses Overseas ($1,000,000).

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must select one complete tier) and the customer's explicit emphasis on comprehensive golf coverage alongside a flexible budget, the Elite tier is the only option that holistically addresses all stated requirements, particularly the critical golfing needs.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides comprehensive and specific coverage for all requested golf-related benefits (Equipment, Hole-in-One, Unused Green Fees, Buggy Damage) via the dedicated Golf Cover section (Section 36).
    *   Offers the highest limits among the tiers for core benefits like Medical Expenses Overseas ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), and Baggage Loss/Damage ($8k).
    *   Includes Amateur Sports Cover, explicitly covering hiking (trekking up to 3,500m).
    *   Provides Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for travellers up to 70 years old.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   While coverage exists for all requirements, the specific limits under Golf Cover (e.g., $1000 for equipment, $250 for green fees, $500 for buggy damage, $500 for hole-in-one) might be lower than the potential costs associated with high-end equipment, premium courses, or significant buggy damage. The customer should be aware of these sub-limits.
