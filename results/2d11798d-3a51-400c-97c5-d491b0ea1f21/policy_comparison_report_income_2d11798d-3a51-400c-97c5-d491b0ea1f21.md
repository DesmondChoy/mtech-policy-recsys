**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers against the customer's requirements reveals significant differences in coverage limits but a common gap regarding specific golf benefits.

*   **Classic:** Offers the lowest limits for core benefits like Trip Cancellation (S$5,000), Medical Expenses Overseas (S$250,000 for under 70s), and Baggage Loss (S$3,000). It covers adventurous activities like hiking but lacks any explicit mention of the specific golf coverages requested (unused green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one).
*   **Deluxe:** Provides higher limits than Classic (Trip Cancellation S$10,000, Medical S$500,000, Baggage S$5,000). It also covers adventurous activities but similarly fails to explicitly address the specific golf requirements.
*   **Preferred:** Offers the highest limits across all core benefits (Trip Cancellation S$15,000, Medical S$1,000,000, Baggage S$8,000) and includes unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for those under 70. While it covers adventurous activities like hiking and the act of golfing, it does *not* explicitly list coverage for unused green fees, accidental damage to a golf buggy, or a hole-in-one benefit. Golf equipment *may* be covered under general baggage loss/damage, but it is not specifically itemized or guaranteed separate cover.

Crucially, none of the available INCOME tiers (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred) explicitly provide the full suite of specific golf coverages requested by the customer (Reimbursement for Unused Green Fees, Accidental Damage to Golf Buggy, Hole-in-One Benefit). Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier.

Since the specific golf benefits are unavailable across all tiers, the best choice is the tier that provides the most comprehensive coverage for the requirements that *are* met, especially the core travel risks. The customer has a flexible budget and requires robust cover for cancellation, medical issues, luggage, delays, and activities (hiking/golfing). The **Preferred** tier offers the highest limits for all these core areas, providing the strongest overall protection despite the identified gaps in specific golf benefits. Therefore, Preferred is recommended as the best available option within the INCOME tiers provided.
