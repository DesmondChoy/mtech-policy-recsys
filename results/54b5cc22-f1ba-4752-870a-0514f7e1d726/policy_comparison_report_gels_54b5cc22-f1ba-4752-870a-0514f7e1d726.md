**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers: The customer's primary requirements include coverage for a pre-existing condition (Asthma), hiking activities, and a double indemnity payout for accidental death on public transport.

*   The **Basic** tier is unsuitable. It explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions, and the necessary add-on benefit is not available for this tier. Furthermore, it does not cover adventurous leisure activities like hiking, nor does it offer the requested public transport double indemnity benefit.
*   The **Gold** tier, when combined with the optional **Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit**, meets all the customer's key requirements. It covers adventurous activities like hiking, includes public transport double indemnity, and the add-on specifically allows coverage for medical expenses, trip cancellation/disruption related to Asthma (subject to limits and co-payments). It also covers trip cancellation, luggage issues, and travel delays with substantial limits ($500k medical, $10k cancellation, $5k luggage loss, $500k double indemnity AD&D for under 70s).
*   The **Platinum** tier, also requiring the **Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit**, similarly meets all requirements but offers higher coverage limits across the board (e.g., $1M medical, $15k cancellation, $1M double indemnity AD&D) and slightly better terms (e.g., 4-hour trigger for delays vs. 6 hours for Gold).

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the choice is between Gold (+AddOn) and Platinum (+AddOn). Both fulfill the necessary coverage requirements. Platinum provides superior limits and terms, but Gold already offers robust coverage that meets the specified needs. Given the customer's budget mention (around $400, although exact pricing isn't provided) and the fact that Gold fulfills all stated requirements, the Gold tier (with the essential Pre-existing conditions add-on) represents the most suitable balance of comprehensive coverage and likely cost-effectiveness compared to Platinum. It meets all needs without potentially exceeding the budget with higher, potentially unnecessary, limits. Therefore, Gold is recommended, with the explicit understanding that the Pre-existing conditions add-on must be purchased.
