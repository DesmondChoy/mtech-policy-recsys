**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a 2-week trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it lacks coverage for hiking injuries (Amateur Sports Cover not included) and explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions, even for emergency evacuation, failing a key customer requirement regarding Asthma. Its overall limits are also the lowest.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier covers hiking injuries (trekking up to 3,500m). It includes coverage for pre-existing conditions *only* for Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation (up to $100k), but based on the provided data, it likely excludes coverage for *treatment* of pre-existing Asthma under standard medical expenses. It does not offer the requested double payout for accidental death on public transport. Limits are moderate ($6k Cancellation, $300k Medical).
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for Japan. Like Deluxe, it covers hiking injuries and includes pre-existing condition coverage *only* for Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation (up to $100k), likely excluding treatment costs. It also does not meet the double payout request. However, it offers a significantly higher Overseas Medical Expenses limit ($500k) compared to Deluxe and includes a valuable cashless medical service network across 740 clinics/hospitals in Japan via EAJ. Cancellation ($6k) and Baggage ($5k) limits match Deluxe.
*   **Elite:** This tier offers the highest limits across all categories ($15k Cancellation, $1M Medical, $8k Baggage) and covers hiking injuries. Similar to Deluxe and GO Japan!, it covers pre-existing conditions *only* for Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation (up to $150k), likely excluding treatment costs, and does not meet the double payout request. While comprehensive, its high limits might be excessive and potentially exceed the budget, especially given the key gaps remain.

**Conclusion:** No tier perfectly meets all requirements, specifically the likely lack of *treatment* coverage for pre-existing Asthma (based on provided JSONs) and the absence of a double AD payout on public transport. However, considering the destination is Japan, the **GO Japan!** tier offers the best balance. It covers hiking, provides higher medical limits than Deluxe, and includes the practical benefit of a cashless medical network in Japan. While it shares the same gaps as Deluxe and Elite regarding pre-existing condition treatment and double AD payout, its Japan-specific features and higher medical limit than Deluxe make it the most suitable *compromise* for this customer, assuming its price is within a reasonable range of the budget. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must accept the entire package of the chosen tier, including its limitations.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: GO Japan!

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Specifically designed for Japan travel, including a cashless medical network (740+ clinics/hospitals via EAJ).
    *   Covers Hiking injuries (trekking up to 3,500m) under Personal Accident and Medical Expenses.
    *   Good Overseas Medical Expense limit ($500k for under 70s).
    *   Covers Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation related to pre-existing conditions (up to $100k limit for under 70s).
    *   Covers Trip Cancellation, Luggage Loss/Damage/Delay, and Travel Delay with reasonable limits.
