**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers cover the core requirements like Trip Cancellation, Medical Expenses, Luggage issues, and Travel Delay, but differ significantly in coverage limits and specific features. Crucially, coverage for the customer's pre-existing Asthma requires purchasing an optional 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on, available for all tiers.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits overall. While it provides Unlimited Emergency Evacuation under the pre-existing condition add-on, the Overseas Medical Expenses limit for this condition is only $50,000 and subject to a 50% co-payment, which is a significant drawback given the customer's concern.
*   **Business:** Provides higher limits than Premium across most categories. Importantly, the pre-existing condition add-on covers Overseas Medical Expenses up to $100,000 (without co-payment) and Emergency Evacuation up to $100,000. This offers substantially better protection for the customer's Asthma concern compared to Premium. It also includes Car Rental Excess cover in the base plan.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits, including $150,000 for both Overseas Medical Expenses and Emergency Evacuation under the pre-existing condition add-on. However, it is the most expensive tier.

A key requirement, the "Double payout for accidental death while using public transportation," is **not explicitly mentioned** as being covered in the provided policy details for *any* of the FWD tiers (Premium, Business, or First) under the Personal Accident section.

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. The Premium tier's 50% co-payment and lower limit for pre-existing medical expenses make it less suitable despite being the cheapest. The First tier offers the highest coverage but is the most expensive and still fails to meet the specific double AD&D payout request.

Therefore, the **Business** tier is recommended. It provides a strong balance between comprehensive coverage (especially the $100,000 medical cover for pre-existing conditions without co-payment) and likely cost (being cheaper than First). While it doesn't meet the double AD&D payout request, neither does the more expensive First tier based on the provided data. Business offers robust protection for the customer's main concerns, including Asthma and hiking, within a potentially more manageable budget than First, aligning better with the "peace of mind is key" sentiment without potentially overspending for the highest tier that still has gaps.

    *   Covers Travel Delay and Baggage Delay with reasonable payout structures.
    *   Covers injuries sustained during leisure hiking under Medical and Personal Accident benefits.
    *   Includes Car Rental Excess cover.
    *   Represents a strong balance between comprehensive coverage and likely cost compared to Premium and First tiers.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Requires purchase of an additional cost add-on for Pre-existing Condition (Asthma) coverage.
    *   Trip Cancellation/Postponement/Cut Short/Disruption due to the pre-existing condition (with the add-on) is subject to a 50% co-payment.
    *   Does not meet the specific request for a double payout for Accidental Death occurring on public transport (based on provided data).
    *   Overall limits are lower than the First tier.
