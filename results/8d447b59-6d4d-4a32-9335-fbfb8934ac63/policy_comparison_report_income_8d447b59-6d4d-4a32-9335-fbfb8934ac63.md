**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers:
*   **Pre-Existing Conditions:** A key requirement is clarity on medical coverage for high blood pressure. Critically, all three standard tiers (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred) explicitly state they **do not cover pre-existing medical conditions** (as noted on Page 5 of each policy document). Therefore, none of these standard tiers meet this specific medical need. The clarity provided is that it is an exclusion.
*   **Hiking:** All tiers cover hiking under "Adventurous activities" with similar conditions (e.g., below 4,000m, safety compliance).
*   **Double Indemnity (Accidental Death on Public Transport):** This is another specific requirement. The Classic tier explicitly states this is 'NA' (Not Available). Both the Deluxe and Preferred tiers offer this benefit, with Preferred providing significantly higher limits (up to $1M vs $400k for adults under 70).
*   **Other Coverage Limits:** For Trip Cancellation, Travel Delay, and Lost/Damaged Luggage, the coverage limits progressively increase from Classic to Deluxe to Preferred. Preferred offers the highest limits ($15k cancellation, $2k delay, $8k luggage).

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. The Classic tier is unsuitable as it fails to meet the mandatory double indemnity requirement. Both Deluxe and Preferred meet the double indemnity and hiking requirements but fail on the pre-existing condition coverage. However, the Preferred tier offers substantially higher limits across all other requested coverage areas (Cancellation, Delay, Luggage, Accidental Death, Medical), providing a much more robust level of protection overall, which aligns better with seeking comprehensive coverage for international travel.

Therefore, the **Preferred** tier is recommended. While it does not cover the pre-existing condition (a significant gap the customer must be aware of), it is the only tier that meets the specific double indemnity requirement while also providing the highest available limits for all other key coverage areas like cancellation, medical, and luggage.
