**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers offer foundational travel insurance benefits like medical cover, trip cancellation, travel delay, and baggage protection. However, they differ significantly in coverage limits and included benefits. Premium offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Overseas Medical, $7.5k Cancellation) and requires purchasing optional add-ons for features like Car Rental Excess. Business provides higher limits (e.g., $500k Overseas Medical, $10k Cancellation) and includes Car Rental Excess as standard. First offers the highest limits across the board (e.g., $1M Overseas Medical, $15k Cancellation) and also includes Car Rental Excess.

A critical requirement for this customer is clarity and coverage for a pre-existing condition (high blood pressure). While all tiers offer an *optional* 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on, the coverage limits under this add-on vary substantially: Premium provides $50k for overseas medical expenses (with a 50% co-payment) and Unlimited evacuation; Business provides $100k for overseas medical expenses and $100k for evacuation; First provides $150k for overseas medical expenses and $150k for evacuation. Given the potential severity and cost associated with medical emergencies related to high blood pressure, especially in a destination like Japan, the higher limits offered by the First tier provide the most robust protection and peace of mind, directly addressing this key concern.

Furthermore, the customer requested details on luggage limits and exclusions. First tier offers the highest overall baggage limit ($7,500) and per-item limits compared to Premium and Business. While the specific request for double indemnity for accidental death on public transport is not met by any of the FWD tiers based on the provided data, the First tier offers the highest base personal accident cover ($400k for adults <70).

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must choose one complete tier) and the customer's emphasis on pre-existing condition coverage and desire for higher limits implicit in seeking detailed information, the First tier provides the most comprehensive and suitable coverage despite being the highest priced option. The significantly higher limits for the crucial pre-existing condition medical coverage make it the superior choice over the Business tier for this specific customer profile.
