**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a two-week trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable. It lacks specific coverage for amateur sports like hiking and explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under the Emergency Medical Evacuation benefit, failing two key customer requirements. Limits are also significantly lower across the board.
*   **Deluxe & GO Japan!:** Both tiers include Amateur Sports Cover, specifically mentioning "trekking up to 3,500m," meeting the hiking requirement. They also offer Emergency Medical Evacuation cover for pre-existing conditions, albeit with a lower sub-limit ($100,000 for under 70s) compared to Elite. Their general coverage limits for cancellation ($6k), luggage ($5k), and AD&D ($250k) are moderate. GO Japan! offers Japan-specific cashless medical services but is otherwise very similar to Deluxe in core coverage relevant to the requirements and is ranked higher in price. Neither tier explicitly confirms the requested double indemnity feature for accidental death on public transport based on the provided data.
*   **Elite:** This tier also covers hiking ("trekking up to 3,500m"). Crucially, it offers the highest sub-limit for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions ($150,000 for under 70s), providing the best available option within SOMPO for this specific concern, although full clarity on general medical expense coverage for the condition would require reviewing the full policy wording. Furthermore, Elite provides substantially higher limits across all other key areas: Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), Travel Delay ($2k max), Luggage ($8k), and Personal Accident ($500k). Like the other tiers, the provided data for Elite does not explicitly confirm the double indemnity feature.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must select a single tier. While the double indemnity feature remains unconfirmed across all tiers based on the provided JSON, the Elite tier offers the most comprehensive package. It meets the hiking requirement, provides the highest level of coverage for emergency evacuation related to the pre-existing condition, and offers significantly higher limits for all other requested coverage types (Medical, Cancellation, Delay, Luggage). Therefore, the Elite tier is recommended as the most suitable option, providing the highest overall protection and best addressing the combination of requirements, despite the lack of confirmation on the double indemnity point within the supplied data.
