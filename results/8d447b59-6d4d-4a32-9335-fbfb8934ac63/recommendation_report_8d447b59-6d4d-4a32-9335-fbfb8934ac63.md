# Travel Insurance Recommendation for Customer 8d447b59-6d4d-4a32-9335-fbfb8934ac63

## Final Recommendation
Based on a detailed analysis of your requirements against available policies, the recommended policy is:

**FWD - First**

### Justification
The final recommendation is FWD First, primarily due to its superior handling of the critical pre-existing medical condition requirement (high blood pressure). While Income Preferred explicitly excludes pre-existing conditions (Page 5) and Sompo Elite only covers Emergency Medical Evacuation for such conditions (up to $150k, Page 3, Section 4), FWD First offers an optional 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on providing substantial coverage for both Overseas Medical Expenses ($150k limit) and Emergency Medical Evacuation ($150k limit) directly related to the condition (Page 9, 24). This explicit and comprehensive medical coverage via the add-on directly addresses the customer's key concern, offering the greatest peace of mind, despite the associated 50% co-payment for related trip cancellation/disruption claims (Page 22-23).

Comparing FWD First to the other finalists:
- **vs. Income Preferred:** Income Preferred meets the specific 'double indemnity' requirement for accidental death on public transport ($1M limit, Page 7, Section 13), which FWD First lacks. However, Income Preferred's complete exclusion of pre-existing conditions makes it unsuitable given the customer's profile. The robust medical coverage offered by FWD First (with the add-on) outweighs the absence of the double indemnity feature.
- **vs. Sompo Elite:** Sompo Elite offers high limits and covers hiking (up to 3,500m, Page 2), similar to FWD First. It also provides coverage for emergency evacuation related to pre-existing conditions ($150k limit, Page 3, Section 4). However, it does not appear to cover general overseas medical expenses for the pre-existing condition, only the evacuation aspect, making FWD First's add-on coverage more comprehensive. Furthermore, Sompo Elite also fails to meet the 'double indemnity' requirement based on the provided data. FWD First offers comparable high limits in other areas ($1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $7.5k Luggage) to Sompo Elite ($1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage).

Therefore, FWD First is selected as the best overall policy. It provides the most robust solution for the crucial pre-existing condition requirement through its specific add-on, offers high limits across essential benefits (Medical, Cancellation, Luggage), and covers the requested hiking activity. The primary trade-off is the lack of the 'double indemnity' feature and the need to purchase the optional pre-existing condition cover.
