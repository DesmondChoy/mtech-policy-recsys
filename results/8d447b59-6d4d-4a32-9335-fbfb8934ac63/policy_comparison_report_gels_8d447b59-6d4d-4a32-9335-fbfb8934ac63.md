**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** Fails significantly as it does not cover "Adventurous leisure activities" (like hiking), offers no coverage or add-on option for pre-existing conditions, lacks the requested "Public transport double indemnity", and does not cover sports equipment loss/damage.
*   **Gold:** Covers "Adventurous leisure activities" (hiking) and "Public transport double indemnity". It offers an *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions (required for the customer's high blood pressure). However, it explicitly *excludes* "Sports equipment cover", failing to meet the customer's need for coverage related to hiking gear loss/damage. Travel delay trigger is 6 hours.
*   **Platinum:** Covers "Adventurous leisure activities" (hiking) and "Public transport double indemnity" with higher limits than Gold. It also offers the *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions with higher limits than Gold. Crucially, Platinum *includes* "Sports equipment cover" (S$1,000 limit), directly addressing the customer's requirement regarding hiking gear. It also features a shorter travel delay trigger (4 hours vs. 6 hours for Gold).

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. While both Gold and Platinum can cover hiking and offer the necessary pre-existing condition add-on and double indemnity, Platinum is the only tier that also includes specific coverage for sports equipment, fulfilling a key customer request regarding luggage specifics for hiking gear. Platinum also offers higher overall limits and better travel delay terms.

Therefore, the Platinum tier is recommended as it provides the most comprehensive coverage aligned with *all* the customer's specific requirements, particularly the inclusion of sports equipment cover, alongside the necessary pre-existing condition add-on capability and double indemnity feature.

    *   Specific per-item limits and detailed exclusions for luggage (e.g., cameras) require review of the full policy wording.
