**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All three tiers provide the core coverages requested by the customer: medical coverage, trip cancellation, travel delays, and lost/damaged luggage. All tiers also cover skiing under their 'Adventurous Activities' benefit, subject to policy conditions regarding safety and leisure participation. The primary difference lies in the coverage limits. Classic offers the lowest limits (e.g., $250k Medical Overseas, $5k Cancellation, $3k Luggage), Deluxe offers mid-range limits (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage), and Preferred offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage).

Crucially, based on the provided policy details, *none* of the tiers (Classic, Deluxe, or Preferred) explicitly mention coverage for the customer's specific additional request: "additional pet accommodation costs due to travel delays".

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must select one tier. Since the pet accommodation requirement cannot be met by any available tier, the decision focuses on which tier best meets the *other* requirements. The Preferred tier is recommended because it offers the most comprehensive protection for the covered requirements with significantly higher limits compared to Classic and Deluxe. These higher limits are particularly beneficial for travel to Japan (where medical costs can be high) and for engaging in activities like skiing, aligning with the customer's age group (41-55) seeking robust protection. While the pet coverage is a gap across all options, Preferred provides the strongest coverage for the core needs and the specified activity.
