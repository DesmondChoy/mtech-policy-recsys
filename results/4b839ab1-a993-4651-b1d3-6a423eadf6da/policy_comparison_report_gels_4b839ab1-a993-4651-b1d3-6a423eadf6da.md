**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic Tier:** Fails to meet key customer requirements. It explicitly excludes coverage for "Adventurous leisure activities" (Section 37), which is necessary for skiing, and does not cover "Pet care" (Section 30) for additional pet accommodation costs due to delays.
*   **Gold Tier:** Meets all core requirements (Medical, Trip Cancellation, Travel Delay, Lost/Damaged Luggage). Crucially, it includes coverage for "Adventurous leisure activities" (Section 37), covering the skiing requirement, and provides "Pet care" coverage (Section 30) for additional pet accommodation costs due to travel delays ($100/day, max $500).
*   **Platinum Tier:** Also meets all core requirements and covers skiing ("Adventurous leisure activities", Section 37) and pet care ("Pet care", Section 30). It offers higher limits than the Gold tier across most categories (e.g., Medical $1M vs $500k, Cancellation $15k vs $10k, Luggage $8k vs $5k, Pet Care $800 vs $500) and a shorter trigger for travel delay payouts (4 hours vs 6 hours). It also adds "Sports equipment cover" (Section 33), which Gold lacks, though this wasn't explicitly requested.

**Selection Rationale:** Both the Gold and Platinum tiers fulfill *all* the customer's stated requirements, including the specific needs for skiing activity coverage and pet accommodation costs. The Basic tier is unsuitable due to missing coverage for these specific needs. Since both Gold and Platinum meet the necessary criteria, they are considered equally suitable for fulfilling the requirements. Applying the Tie-Breaking Rule (select the cheapest among equally suitable options based on the price ranking: Basic < Gold < Platinum), the Gold tier is chosen. It provides all necessary coverage at a lower price point than the Platinum tier.
