**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) for this customer traveling to Japan for 2 weeks with skiing:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it does not appear to offer specific coverage for amateur sports like skiing, which is a key requirement. It also has the lowest coverage limits overall.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier covers the core requirements (Medical $300k, Cancellation $6k, Delay $1k max, Luggage $5k) and explicitly includes skiing under its Amateur Sports cover. However, it lacks the Japan-specific medical benefits and higher medical limit offered by the GO Japan! tier.
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for travel to Japan. It covers all core requirements (Medical $500k, Cancellation $6k, Delay $1k max, Luggage $5k), explicitly includes skiing cover, and offers enhanced medical benefits like a higher overseas medical limit ($500k) and access to cashless medical services at numerous facilities in Japan. This directly addresses the customer's destination and activity needs well.
*   **Elite:** This tier offers the highest limits across all categories (Medical $1M, Cancellation $15k, Delay $2k max, Luggage $8k) and covers skiing. While providing robust coverage, these high limits may exceed the customer's stated needs, and it comes at the highest price point without offering the Japan-specific medical network access of the GO Japan! tier.

**Crucially, none of the available SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) explicitly mention coverage for the customer's additional request: "additional pet accommodation costs due to travel delays."** This requirement cannot be met by any of these options.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the GO Japan! tier is selected as the single most suitable option. It meets all core requirements, specifically covers the requested skiing activity, and provides valuable Japan-focused benefits (higher medical limit than Deluxe, cashless service network) that align perfectly with the customer's destination. While it doesn't cover the pet accommodation costs (a gap shared by all tiers), it offers the best overall fit for the combination of destination, activities, and core coverage needs compared to Deluxe (less Japan-specific) and Elite (potentially excessive limits and costlier without fulfilling the pet requirement).
