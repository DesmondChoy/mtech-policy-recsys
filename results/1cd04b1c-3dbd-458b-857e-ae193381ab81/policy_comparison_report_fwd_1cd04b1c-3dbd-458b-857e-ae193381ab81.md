**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers cover the core requirements of Medical, Trip Cancellation, Travel Delays, and Lost/Damaged Luggage, but with varying limits. Premium offers the lowest limits (e.g., S$200k Medical Overseas, S$7.5k Cancellation, S$3k Luggage), which may not align with the customer's desire for "comprehensive" coverage, especially concerning medical needs. Business provides significantly higher limits (S$500k Medical Overseas, S$10k Cancellation, S$5k Luggage), offering a substantial level of protection. First offers the highest limits (S$1M Medical Overseas, S$15k Cancellation, S$7.5k Luggage).

Crucially, coverage for Golf Equipment requires purchasing the *optional* "Sports equipment protector" add-on, which has the same S$2,000 limit regardless of whether it's added to the Premium, Business, or First tier. None of the tiers, including the optional add-on, provide coverage for the requested "Hole-in-One achievement benefit".

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must select a single tier plus any desired add-ons. Premium's lower limits make it less suitable for a customer seeking comprehensive cover. Both Business and First offer robust coverage levels that could be considered "comprehensive". Business provides a strong balance with good limits across key areas, while First offers the maximum available protection. Since both Business and First adequately meet the need for comprehensive coverage types (when including the necessary add-on) and provide substantial limits, they are considered more suitable than Premium. Applying the Tie-Breaking Rule (Premium < Business < First), the Business tier is selected as the cheaper option among the suitable tiers. It provides strong, comprehensive coverage limits that significantly exceed the Premium tier, addresses the core needs, and allows for the addition of the required Golf Equipment cover, representing the best overall fit based on the requirements and pricing structure.
