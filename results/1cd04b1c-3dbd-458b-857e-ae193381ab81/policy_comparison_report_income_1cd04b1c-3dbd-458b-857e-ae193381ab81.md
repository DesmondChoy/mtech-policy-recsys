**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All tiers provide foundational coverage for the customer's core requirements, including Medical Expenses (Overseas and Singapore follow-up), Trip Cancellation, Travel Delays, and Lost/Damaged Luggage. All tiers also cover participation in Golf under their Adventurous Activities clauses.

However, a key difference lies in the coverage limits. The Preferred tier offers significantly higher limits across the board compared to Classic and Deluxe:
*   **Medical Overseas:** $1,000,000 (Preferred) vs $500,000 (Deluxe) vs $250,000 (Classic) for adults under 70.
*   **Trip Cancellation:** $15,000 (Preferred) vs $10,000 (Deluxe) vs $5,000 (Classic) per person.
*   **Lost/Damaged Luggage:** $8,000 (Preferred) vs $5,000 (Deluxe) vs $3,000 (Classic) per person overall limit.

Crucially, **none of the INCOME tiers (Classic, Deluxe, or Preferred) offer specific, dedicated coverage for Golf Equipment beyond the standard 'Loss or damage of baggage and personal belongings' section, nor do they offer a Hole-in-One benefit.** Golf equipment under all tiers is subject to the standard per-item limit ($500 in Preferred). This is a significant gap given the customer's explicit request and mention of expensive equipment.

Despite this shared limitation regarding specific golf benefits, the Preferred tier is recommended. The customer requested "comprehensive" coverage and expressed concern about the extent of medical cover and the need for robust trip cancellation. The Preferred tier's substantially higher limits for these core areas best align with the request for comprehensive protection. While the $500 per-item limit for golf equipment remains a constraint, the higher overall baggage limit ($8,000) in the Preferred tier offers a slightly larger buffer than the lower tiers. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier, and Preferred provides the most robust coverage for the non-golf-specific requirements emphasized by the customer.
