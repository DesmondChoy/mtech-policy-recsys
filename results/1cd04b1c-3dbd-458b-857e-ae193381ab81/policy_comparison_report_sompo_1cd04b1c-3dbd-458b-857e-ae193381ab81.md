**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, Elite) for the customer's trip to Australia, considering the specific requirements:
*   **Vital:** Offers basic coverage but lacks any specific Golf Cover section. Golf equipment would fall under general baggage with low item limits ($250), and there is no coverage for Hole-in-One, unused green fees, or buggy damage. Medical and cancellation limits are also the lowest.
*   **Deluxe:** Includes a 'Golf Cover' section, but it only covers loss/damage to equipment up to $500. It explicitly states Hole-in-One, unused green fees, and buggy damage are 'N.A.' (Not Applicable). While better than Vital, it fails to meet several key golf-related requirements.
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for travel to Japan and is therefore unsuitable for the customer's trip to Australia.
*   **Elite:** Provides the highest limits for core coverage like Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), and Baggage ($8k). Crucially, it features a comprehensive 'Golf Cover' section (Section 36) that specifically addresses:
    *   Loss or damage of golf equipment (up to $1000)
    *   Hole-in-one benefit ($500, though potentially conditional on competition play)
    *   Unused green fees ($250)
    *   Damage of buggy ($500)

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (coverages cannot be combined across tiers), the Elite tier is the only option from SOMPO that holistically addresses all the customer's stated requirements, particularly the specific and comprehensive golf coverage needs alongside high limits for general travel risks. The Tie-Breaking Rule was not needed as Elite is clearly the most suitable tier based on coverage alignment.
