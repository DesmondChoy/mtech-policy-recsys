**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, and Elite tiers against the customer's requirements for a trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for amateur sports like hiking ("Amateur Sports Cover" N.A., Page 2 Highlights & Page 5 Section 28), which is a specific activity the customer requires cover for.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier covers the core requirements, including medical expenses ($300k overseas), baggage issues ($5k loss/damage), trip cancellation ($6k), travel delay ($1k max), accidental death ($250k), and hiking (via Amateur Sports Cover). However, its medical limit is lower than GO Japan!, and it lacks Japan-specific benefits.
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for travel to Japan. It covers all the core requirements like Deluxe, but offers a higher overseas medical expense limit ($500k) and includes a valuable cashless medical service feature at numerous clinics and hospitals in Japan (Page 2, GO Japan!). It also covers hiking (via Amateur Sports Cover).
*   **Elite:** This tier offers the highest limits across all categories (e.g., $1M medical, $15k cancellation, $500k AD). It covers hiking (via Amateur Sports Cover). However, it lacks the Japan-specific cashless medical feature provided by the GO Japan! tier and is the most expensive option.

The customer's specific request for a "Double payout for accidental death while using public transport" is not mentioned as a feature in the provided details for *any* of the SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite). Therefore, this requirement cannot be met by any available option from this insurer.

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. Vital is eliminated due to the lack of hiking cover. Between Deluxe, GO Japan!, and Elite, all cover the main requirements including hiking. However, GO Japan! stands out as the most suitable choice. It provides robust coverage limits (higher medical than Deluxe) and includes the highly relevant cashless medical service specifically for Japan, directly addressing the customer's destination and concern about overseas medical processes. While Elite offers higher limits, GO Japan! provides substantial coverage that meets the general requirements, enhanced by the destination-specific benefit, making it the best overall fit without potentially unnecessary higher costs associated with Elite.

Therefore, the **GO Japan!** tier is recommended as it comprehensively covers all stated requirements (except the unavailable double AD payout), includes specific coverage for hiking, and offers a significant advantage with its Japan-focused cashless medical services, providing the best balance of coverage and destination-specific features.
