**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic Tier:** Covers core needs like medical expenses (SGD 100k), baggage loss (SGD 2.5k), trip cancellation (SGD 2k), and travel delay (SGD 500 overseas). However, it explicitly **does not cover** the 'Public transport double indemnity' requested by the customer, nor does it cover 'Adventurous leisure activities', which is necessary for the customer's planned hiking. Therefore, the Basic tier is unsuitable as it fails to meet two specific requirements.
*   **Gold Tier:** Provides significantly higher limits than Basic for core coverage (e.g., SGD 500k medical, SGD 10k cancellation, SGD 5k baggage loss, SGD 250k accidental death). Crucially, it **includes coverage** for 'Adventurous leisure activities' (covering hiking) and provides the requested 'Public transport double indemnity' (up to SGD 500k). It meets all the customer's stated requirements.
*   **Platinum Tier:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., SGD 1M medical, SGD 15k cancellation, SGD 8k baggage loss, SGD 500k accidental death) and also covers 'Adventurous leisure activities' and 'Public transport double indemnity' (up to SGD 1M). It also has slightly better triggers for delays (4 hours vs 6 hours for Gold).

While Platinum offers higher limits, the Gold tier already provides substantial coverage that fully meets all the customer's specified needs, including the specific requests for hiking coverage and public transport double indemnity. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, a single tier must be chosen. Both Gold and Platinum satisfy the requirements. Applying the Tie-Breaking Rule (select the cheapest among equally suitable options based on the price ranking: Basic < Gold < Platinum), the Gold tier is the most suitable recommendation.
