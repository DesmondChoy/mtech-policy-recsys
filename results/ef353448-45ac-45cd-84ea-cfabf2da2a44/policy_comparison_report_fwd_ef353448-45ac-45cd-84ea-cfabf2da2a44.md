**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers provide coverage for the core requirements requested by the customer, including medical expenses, baggage issues, trip cancellation, travel delay (>= 6 hours), accidental death, and accidents during leisure activities like hiking (assuming standard leisure hiking based on typical policy wording, as specific exclusions aren't detailed for this activity in the provided JSON). The key differences lie in the coverage limits and the handling of the specific request for a double accidental death payout on public transport.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Medical, $7.5k Cancellation, $200k Personal Accident). While it covers the types of events, the medical limit might be insufficient given the customer's expressed concern about potentially high costs in Japan.
*   **Business:** Provides significantly higher mid-range limits (e.g., $500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $300k Personal Accident). This offers a more robust level of protection, particularly for medical emergencies, better addressing the customer's concern.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $400k Personal Accident), providing the most comprehensive coverage but is also the most expensive tier according to the price ranking.

Crucially, none of the tiers explicitly mention the requested "Double payout for accidental death while using public transport" within their Personal Accident benefit details in the provided JSON. Therefore, this specific additional request cannot be met by any standard FWD tier based on the available information.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must select a single tier. Since the double AD payout is unavailable across all tiers, the decision hinges on balancing the core coverage levels against potential cost. Premium's medical limit seems potentially inadequate. First provides very high limits but is the most expensive. The Business tier strikes the best balance: it comprehensively covers all core requirement types, offers substantial limits (especially the $500k medical) that address the customer's primary concern better than Premium, and is more cost-effective than the First tier.

Therefore, the **Business** tier is recommended as the most suitable option, providing a strong level of coverage for the customer's stated needs at a mid-range price point, acknowledging that the specific double AD payout feature is not available.
