**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions (a critical requirement for the customer's high blood pressure) and does not offer the requested Public Transport Double Indemnity benefit. It also lacks coverage for adventurous leisure activities, potentially excluding hiking.
*   **Gold:** This tier meets several requirements, including covering adventurous leisure activities (like hiking) and offering Public Transport Double Indemnity. However, coverage for the pre-existing condition (high blood pressure) and related trip cancellation/disruption requires purchasing an *optional add-on benefit*. The travel delay trigger is 6 hours.
*   **Platinum:** This tier also covers adventurous leisure activities and Public Transport Double Indemnity. Similar to Gold, coverage for the pre-existing condition requires the *optional add-on benefit*. However, Platinum offers significantly higher coverage limits across key areas like Medical Expenses Overseas (S$1M vs S$500k), Trip Cancellation (S$15k vs S$10k), and Accidental Death (S$500k vs S$250k). Crucially, the trigger for Travel Delay and Baggage Delay benefits is shorter (4 hours vs 6 hours for Gold), better addressing the customer's concern about long waits.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must choose one complete tier plus any relevant add-ons), both Gold and Platinum could potentially meet the requirements *if the pre-existing condition add-on is purchased*. However, the customer requested "Comprehensive" and "top-tier" coverage with a "flexible budget". Platinum aligns better with this expectation due to its substantially higher limits and the improved 4-hour delay trigger, offering a more robust safety net.

Therefore, the Platinum tier (with the mandatory purchase of the Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit) is recommended as it provides the highest level of coverage, includes all specific benefits requested (Public Transport Double Indemnity, Hiking cover), addresses the pre-existing condition (via add-on), and has a more favourable delay trigger, best matching the customer's desire for comprehensive, top-tier protection.

*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**

    *   Claims related to the pre-existing condition are subject to specific sub-limits within the add-on.
    *   Co-payments apply for certain claims related to the pre-existing condition (S$100 per outpatient medical visit, 50% for trip cancellation/postponement/disruption).
