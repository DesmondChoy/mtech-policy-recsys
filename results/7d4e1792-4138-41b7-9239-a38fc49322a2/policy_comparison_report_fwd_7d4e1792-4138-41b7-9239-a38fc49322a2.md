**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers cover the core requirements like Medical, Trip Cancellation, Luggage, Travel Delay, and Accidental Death, and all offer an *optional* add-on for Pre-existing Medical Conditions, which is essential for this customer's high blood pressure. Hiking is considered a standard leisure activity and is not excluded in any tier. However, the key differentiators are the coverage limits and specific benefits.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Overseas Medical, $7.5k Cancellation, $50k Pre-existing Medical add-on limit). This may not align with the customer's request for "Comprehensive" and "top-tier" coverage for a 3-week trip to Europe.
*   **Business:** Provides moderate limits (e.g., $500k Overseas Medical, $10k Cancellation, $100k Pre-existing Medical add-on limit). It includes Car Rental Excess cover ($500) as standard.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits across the board (e.g., $1M Overseas Medical, $15k Cancellation, $150k Pre-existing Medical add-on limit, $1000 Car Rental Excess). This best matches the customer's desire for "Comprehensive" and "top-tier" coverage, especially given the importance of robust medical cover for the pre-existing condition.

Crucially, the customer's specific request for a **double payout for accidental death on public transport** is **not met by any FWD tier**. While all tiers cover Accidental Death, none include this specific multiplier clause.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose the tier that best fits *overall*. The First tier, despite not meeting the double AD payout requirement, provides the highest level of protection for all other core requirements, particularly the medical and pre-existing condition coverage, which were emphasized by the customer. The higher limits offered by First make it the most suitable choice for comprehensive protection during a 3-week European trip, aligning with the customer's stated preference for top-tier coverage over the lowest price.

Therefore, the **First** tier is recommended as it offers the highest coverage limits, especially for medical expenses and the essential pre-existing condition add-on, best fulfilling the customer's need for comprehensive, top-tier insurance, even though the specific double AD payout benefit is unavailable.
