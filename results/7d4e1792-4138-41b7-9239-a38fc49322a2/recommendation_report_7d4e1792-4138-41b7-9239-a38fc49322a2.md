## Final Recommendation
Based on a detailed analysis of your requirements against available policies, the recommended policy is:

**GELS - Platinum**

### Justification
The final recommendation is GELS Platinum, primarily because it is the only candidate policy that comprehensively meets *all* critical customer requirements when the necessary add-on is included, aligning best with the request for 'comprehensive' and 'top-tier' coverage.

**Comparison Rationale:**

1.  **Pre-existing Condition (High Blood Pressure):** This is a non-negotiable requirement. INCOME Preferred's standard plan explicitly excludes this (Report 1, Page 5), making it unsuitable despite its strengths elsewhere. Both FWD First (Report 2, Page 9, Optional Covers) and GELS Platinum (Report 3, Page 5, Section 38) offer optional add-on coverage for pre-existing conditions. GELS Platinum provides a slightly higher medical expense limit for this add-on (S$200k vs FWD's S$150k), although it comes with co-payments (S$100 outpatient medical, 50% trip disruption/cancellation - Report 3, Page 5, Footnote #).

2.  **Double Accidental Death Payout on Public Transport:** This was a specific additional request. GELS Platinum explicitly includes this benefit, doubling the AD&D payout up to S$1M for adults under 70 (Report 3, Page 3, Section 2). INCOME Preferred also meets this requirement (Report 1, Page 7, Section 13). However, FWD First *does not* offer this specific double indemnity feature (Report 2, Page 18), failing to meet this key customer request.

3.  **Comprehensive Coverage & Other Requirements:** All three finalists offer high limits suitable for 'top-tier' coverage. GELS Platinum provides S$1M medical, S$15k cancellation, S$500k base AD&D, covers hiking (Report 3, Page 5, Section 37), and has a favourable 4-hour trigger for travel/baggage delay benefits (Report 3, Page 4, Sections 21 & 25), which is better than the 6-hour trigger often seen (including in INCOME Preferred and potentially FWD First, although FWD's report doesn't specify the trigger time for comparison). FWD First offers similar high limits and includes car rental excess cover (Report 2, Page 7), which GELS does not highlight, but the lack of the double AD payout is a significant gap against the requirements.

**Conclusion & Trade-offs:** While FWD First offers strong coverage and potentially simpler pre-existing condition claim processing (no medical co-pay mentioned), it fails on the specific double AD payout requirement. INCOME Preferred fails on the critical pre-existing condition requirement. GELS Platinum, despite requiring an add-on purchase and having co-payments for pre-existing condition claims, successfully addresses *all* requirements, including the crucial pre-existing condition coverage and the specific double AD payout request. Its high limits and better delay trigger further solidify its position as the most aligned 'top-tier' option fulfilling the customer's stated needs.
