**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers: The Basic tier is unsuitable as it completely lacks the specific 'Golfer's cover' required by the customer (Section 32), failing to meet requirements for golf equipment, unused green fees, and the hole-in-one benefit. Both the Gold and Platinum tiers include a dedicated 'Golfer's cover' section (Section 32) which addresses these specific needs, alongside standard coverage for trip cancellation, travel delay, medical expenses, and lost luggage.

The Gold tier provides coverage for golf equipment (S$500), unused green fees (S$250), and a hole-in-one benefit (S$250). It also includes standard coverages like Trip Cancellation (S$10,000), Travel Delay (S$100/6hrs), Medical Expenses Overseas (S$500,000), and Baggage Loss (S$5000). The Platinum tier offers higher limits for these benefits (e.g., S$1000 for golf equipment, S$15,000 Trip Cancellation, S$1M Medical) and a slightly better travel delay trigger (S$100/4hrs).

However, the customer requested specific *types* of coverage (including the golf elements) rather than specifying high monetary limits. Both Gold and Platinum tiers fulfill the *types* of coverage requested, including the essential Golfer's Cover. The coverage for 'golf buggy damage liability' is not explicitly listed under Golfer's Cover in either tier; it may potentially fall under 'Rental vehicle excess' (S$1000 in Gold, S$1500 in Platinum), but this is uncertain. Since both Gold and Platinum meet the fundamental requirements list (with the same uncertainty around buggy liability) and address the critical need for specific golf coverage which Basic lacks, they are considered functionally suitable in meeting the stated needs.

Applying the Tie-Breaking Rule (select the cheapest among equally suitable options), the Gold tier is recommended as it meets all specified coverage types at a lower price point than the Platinum tier.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Gold

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides the specific 'Golfer's cover' requested, including benefits for equipment, unused green fees, and hole-in-one.
    *   Covers all standard requirements (trip cancellation, travel delay, medical expenses, lost luggage) with reasonable limits.
    *   More cost-effective than the Platinum tier while still meeting the specified coverage types.
    *   Includes coverage for adventurous leisure activities (golf).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Golf Buggy Damage Liability: Coverage is uncertain; it's not explicitly mentioned and relies on the interpretation of 'Rental vehicle excess' potentially applying to a golf buggy. Assessed as Partially Met.
    *   Golf Equipment Limit: The S$500 limit under Golfer's Cover might be insufficient for very high-value equipment.
