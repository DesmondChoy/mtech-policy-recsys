**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

The customer requires comprehensive travel insurance for a golf trip to Japan, including standard coverage (trip cancellation, travel delay, medical, luggage) and specific golf-related benefits (equipment, unused green fees, buggy damage liability, hole-in-one).

Comparing the available SOMPO TravelJoy tiers:
*   **Vital:** Provides basic coverage but lacks any specific Golf Cover section and does not meet the customer's activity-specific needs.
*   **Deluxe:** Includes basic Golf Cover for equipment loss/damage ($500) but explicitly states Hole-in-one, Unused green fees, and Damage of buggy are 'N.A.' (Not Applicable). It fails to meet several key golf requirements.
*   **GO Japan!:** Despite being tailored for Japan (e.g., cashless medical), its Golf Cover is identical to the Deluxe tier, only covering equipment loss/damage ($500) and explicitly excluding the other required golf benefits (Hole-in-one, Unused green fees, Damage of buggy are 'N.A.'). It fails to meet the specific activity requirements.
*   **Elite:** Offers the highest limits for core coverage (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage) and, crucially, includes a comprehensive 'Golf Cover' section (Section 36) that addresses *all* the customer's specific requests: loss/damage of golf equipment ($1000), hole-in-one benefit ($500), unused green fees ($250), and damage of buggy ($500).

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must select a single tier that covers all their needs. Only the Elite tier provides the necessary comprehensive coverage for both standard travel risks and the specific requirements related to their golf activity. Therefore, Elite is the only suitable option and is recommended. The tie-breaking rule was not required as only one tier met all requirements.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides comprehensive coverage for all specific golf-related requirements (equipment, unused fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one) via the dedicated Golf Cover section, which other tiers lack.
    *   Offers the highest coverage limits across all core categories (Medical, Cancellation, Luggage, Delay).
    *   Includes Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for travellers up to 70 years old.
    *   Covers standard medical needs thoroughly.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Hole-in-one benefit: Coverage is conditional on the hole-in-one being achieved during a competition, which may not align with the customer's plans if playing casually.
