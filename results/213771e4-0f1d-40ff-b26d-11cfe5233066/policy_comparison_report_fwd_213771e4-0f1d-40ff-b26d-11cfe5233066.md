**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the customer's 10-day golf trip to Japan: All tiers cover the core requirements of trip cancellation, travel delay, standard medical expenses, and lost/damaged luggage, but with varying limits. Premium offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k overseas medical), Business offers mid-range limits (e.g., $500k overseas medical), and First offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M overseas medical, $15k cancellation).

Crucially, none of the FWD tiers inherently cover the specific golf package requested.
*   **Golf Equipment:** Requires purchasing the optional 'Sports equipment protector' add-on ($2k limit) across all tiers. Significantly, this add-on excludes cover for damage that occurs while the equipment is in use (practice or play).
*   **Unused Green Fees:** Not covered by any tier.
*   **Golf Buggy Damage Liability:** Not covered. The Personal Liability benefit in all tiers explicitly excludes liability arising from the use of motorised vehicles. While Business and First include Car Rental Excess cover by default, this applies to damage *to* a rental *car* and does not cover liability arising from using a golf buggy.
*   **Hole-in-One Benefit:** Not covered by any tier.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. Since the specific golf requirements (beyond equipment) are unmet by all tiers, and equipment cover requires a flawed add-on available for all, the decision rests on the best coverage for the core requirements. Premium's $200k medical limit may be insufficient for Japan. Both Business and First offer more robust core coverage. First provides the highest limits overall ($1M medical, $15k cancellation, $7.5k baggage, $1k Car Rental Excess), offering the strongest protection against standard travel risks.

Therefore, the **First** tier is recommended as it provides the most comprehensive coverage for the core requirements (medical, cancellation, baggage, delay) which are essential for any trip, especially to a destination like Japan. While it fails to meet most of the specific golf requirements adequately (requiring an optional, limited add-on for equipment and offering no cover for green fees, buggy liability, or hole-in-one), it represents the best available foundation within the FWD options presented. The significant gaps in golf-specific coverage must be noted.
