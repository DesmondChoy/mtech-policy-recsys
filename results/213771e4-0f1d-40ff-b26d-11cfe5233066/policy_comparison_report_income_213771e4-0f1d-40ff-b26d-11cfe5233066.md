**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All three tiers provide coverage for the customer's core requirements, including trip cancellation, travel delay, standard medical expenses, and lost/damaged luggage, albeit with varying limits (Preferred offering the highest, followed by Deluxe, then Classic).

However, a critical part of the customer's request is specific coverage related to their golf trip: golf equipment, unused green fees, golf buggy damage liability, and a hole-in-one benefit. Analyzing the provided policy details for all three tiers (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred), **none** of them explicitly list or include dedicated benefits for unused green fees, golf buggy damage liability, or a hole-in-one. Golf equipment would fall under the general 'Loss or damage of baggage and personal belongings' coverage, which has a per-item limit of S$500 in all three tiers â€“ this may be insufficient for expensive golf equipment. While Personal Liability exists in all tiers (highest in Preferred at S$1M), its applicability to damage to a rented golf buggy is uncertain and often excluded for property under the insured's care or control; the Rental Vehicle Excess cover is typically for cars, not buggies.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. Since none of the available INCOME tiers fully satisfy the specific golf-related requirements, the decision must be based on the tier that best covers the core requirements and offers the highest limits for potentially relevant general coverages (like overall baggage and personal liability). The Preferred tier provides the highest limits for trip cancellation (S$15,000), overseas medical expenses (S$1,000,000 for under 70s), overall baggage (S$8,000), and personal liability (S$1,000,000).

Therefore, the **Preferred** tier is recommended as it offers the most comprehensive protection for the core travel risks and the highest available limits under general categories that might partially apply (like baggage for equipment), despite its significant weakness in lacking the specific golf coverages explicitly requested by the customer. The customer must be made aware of these gaps.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Preferred

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides the highest coverage limits among the INCOME tiers for core requirements like Trip Cancellation (S$15k), Overseas Medical Expenses (S$1M for under 70s), and overall Lost/Damaged Baggage (S$8k).
    *   Includes high Personal Liability cover (S$1M).
    *   Covers standard requirements like travel delay and medical expenses comprehensively (within limits).
    *   Includes cover for adventurous activities (though golf isn't typically classified as such, general medical/accident cover would apply if injured during play).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Does not meet the specific requirement for unused green fees reimbursement.
    *   Does not meet the specific requirement for golf buggy damage liability.
    *   Does not meet the specific requirement for a hole-in-one benefit.
    *   Golf Equipment coverage falls under general baggage with a S$500 per item/set/pair limit, which is likely insufficient for valuable golf clubs (Partially Met).
