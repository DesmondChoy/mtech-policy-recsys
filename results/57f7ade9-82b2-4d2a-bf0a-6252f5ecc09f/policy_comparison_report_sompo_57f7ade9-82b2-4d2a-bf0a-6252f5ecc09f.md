**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, and Elite tiers for this customer's 2-week trip to Japan for two travelers:

*   **Vital:** This tier is the cheapest but fails to meet key requirements. It lacks explicit coverage for hiking activities (Amateur Sports Cover including trekking is not highlighted for Vital in the provided details) and offers the lowest limits for core benefits like medical ($150k overseas) and baggage ($3k). It also does not cover the requested pet accommodation costs.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier meets the core requirements for standard medical ($300k overseas), trip cancellation ($6k), travel delay ($1k max), lost luggage ($5k), and explicitly covers hiking up to 3,500m. However, it does not offer Japan-specific benefits and does not cover pet accommodation costs. It is cheaper than GO Japan!.
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier offers identical coverage to Deluxe for trip cancellation, travel delay, luggage, and hiking. Crucially, it provides a higher overseas medical limit ($500k) and includes Japan-specific benefits like cashless medical services at numerous clinics/hospitals and a dedicated 24-hour assistance hotline (EAJ) for Japan. This directly enhances the travel experience and safety for the specified destination. Like the other tiers, it does not cover pet accommodation costs.
*   **Elite:** This tier offers the highest coverage limits across the board (e.g., $1M medical, $15k cancellation) and covers hiking. However, it is the most expensive tier, likely exceeding the customer's budget of "around $400", and still does not cover pet accommodation costs.

**Conclusion:** The customer's request for pet accommodation coverage cannot be met by any available SOMPO tier based on the provided policy details. Focusing on the remaining requirements, both Deluxe and GO Japan! cover the core needs including hiking. However, given the specific destination is Japan, the **GO Japan!** tier is deemed *most suitable*. Although ranked slightly higher in price than Deluxe, its enhanced overseas medical limit ($500k vs $300k) and valuable Japan-specific features (cashless medical access, dedicated Japan hotline) provide significant advantages and convenience tailored precisely to this trip. These destination-specific benefits make it a better holistic fit than the more generic Deluxe plan, justifying the potential slight increase in cost while likely remaining more budget-conscious than Elite. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose a single tier, and GO Japan! offers the best package for *this specific journey*.
