**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** Covers standard medical ($100k overseas), trip cancellation ($2k), travel delay ($500/$100 per 6hrs), and lost luggage ($2.5k). However, it explicitly **does not cover** adventurous leisure activities (which includes hiking) and **does not cover** pet care costs due to travel delays. Therefore, it fails to meet two key customer requirements.
*   **Gold:** Provides higher limits for standard coverage (Medical $500k overseas, Cancellation $10k, Delay $1500/$100 per 6hrs, Luggage $5k). Crucially, it **covers** adventurous leisure activities (including hiking) and **includes Pet Care** coverage ($500 limit, $100/day) for additional accommodation costs due to delays. This tier meets all stated customer requirements.
*   **Platinum:** Offers the highest limits (Medical $1M overseas, Cancellation $15k, Delay $2000/$100 per 4hrs, Luggage $8k). It also covers adventurous activities (hiking) and Pet Care ($800 limit, $100/day). While it meets all requirements and offers superior coverage (e.g., faster delay trigger), it is the most expensive tier.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the Basic tier is unsuitable. Both Gold and Platinum meet all the customer's requirements. Platinum offers higher limits and faster delay payouts, but Gold sufficiently covers all specified needs (standard medical, cancellation, delay, luggage, hiking, pet care) without potentially exceeding the customer's budget preference ("around $400") as much as the highest tier might. Since both Gold and Platinum fulfill all the essential requirements outlined by the customer, they can be considered equally suitable in terms of meeting the core needs. Applying the Tie-Breaking Rule (select the cheapest among equally suitable options), the Gold tier is recommended as it appears earlier in the price ranking (Basic, Gold, Platinum) than Platinum.
