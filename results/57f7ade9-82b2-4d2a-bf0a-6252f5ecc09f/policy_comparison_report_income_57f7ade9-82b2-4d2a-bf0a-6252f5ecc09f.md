**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All three tiers cover the customer's core requirements for standard medical expenses, trip cancellation, travel delays, lost/damaged luggage, and hiking activities (subject to policy conditions). However, they differ significantly in coverage limits. Classic offers the lowest limits (e.g., $250k medical, $5k cancellation per person), Deluxe offers intermediate limits (e.g., $500k medical, $10k cancellation per person), and Preferred offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M medical, $15k cancellation per person).

Crucially, none of the tiers explicitly cover the customer's specific request for "additional pet accommodation costs" resulting from travel delays.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. While Classic meets the basic types of coverage requested, its limits might be considered low for a destination like Japan, especially with hiking involved. Preferred offers very high limits but may exceed the customer's definition of "standard" needs and potentially their budget ("around $400" for two people).

The Deluxe tier strikes the best balance. It provides substantially higher limits than Classic for key areas like medical (double) and cancellation (double), offering a more robust level of "standard" protection suitable for the trip and activities, without the potentially unnecessary expense and high limits of the Preferred tier. Therefore, Deluxe is recommended as the most holistically suitable option, providing solid coverage for all core requirements and activities within a likely more manageable cost range compared to Preferred, despite not covering the specific pet accommodation request (which no tier covers).
