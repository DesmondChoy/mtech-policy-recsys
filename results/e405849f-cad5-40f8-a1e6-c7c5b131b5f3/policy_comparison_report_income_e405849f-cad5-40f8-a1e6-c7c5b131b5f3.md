**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All three tiers cover the core requirements requested by the customer, including Medical Coverage (for unexpected events, *not* pre-existing asthma), Scuba Diving (under Adventurous Activities), Trip Cancellation, Travel Delay, and Lost/Damaged Luggage. However, they differ significantly in their coverage limits.

*   **Classic:** Provides the most basic limits (e.g., $5k Cancellation, $3k Luggage, $250k Medical Overseas for under 70s).
*   **Deluxe:** Offers improved limits (e.g., $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage, $500k Medical Overseas, Unlimited Evacuation for under 70s).
*   **Preferred:** Provides the highest limits across the board (e.g., $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage, $1M Medical Overseas, Unlimited Evacuation for under 70s).

Crucially, none of these standard tiers cover pre-existing conditions like asthma, nor do they explicitly cover additional pet accommodation costs due to travel delays. These are gaps common to all three options presented.

Given the customer's expressed anxieties about significant medical costs, losing money on cancellation ("awful to think about"), and the "nightmare" of lost luggage, the higher limits offered by the Preferred tier provide the most robust safety net for these specific concerns. While Deluxe is a strong middle option, the substantially higher limits in Preferred ($1M vs $500k medical, $15k vs $10k cancellation, $8k vs $5k luggage) better align with the desire for "proper cover". Since the key gaps (asthma, pet hotel) cannot be addressed by any of these standard tiers and the customer must choose one complete tier (No Mix-and-Match Rule), the Preferred tier is recommended as it best addresses the *covered* risks at the highest available level within this insurer's standard offerings.
