**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for this customer: All tiers cover the basic requirements like Trip Cancellation, Travel Delay, and Lost/Damaged Luggage, but with varying limits increasing from Premium to First. Crucially, coverage for the pre-existing condition (asthma) and the additional pet accommodation costs requires purchasing optional add-ons ('Pre-existing medical conditions' and 'Pet care'), which are available across all tiers.

However, the level of coverage for the critical 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on differs significantly:
*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits, notably $50,000 for Overseas Medical Expenses (with a 50% co-payment) and Unlimited Evacuation. The co-payment and lower medical limit may not adequately address the customer's expressed anxiety about potential asthma-related medical needs overseas.
*   **Business:** Provides higher limits with $100,000 for Overseas Medical Expenses and $100,000 for Evacuation under the add-on, offering a better safety net than Premium. Base limits for other coverages are also higher.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits under the 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on, with $150,000 for Overseas Medical Expenses and $150,000 for Evacuation. It also provides the highest base limits across all core coverage areas (e.g., $1M Overseas Medical, $15k Trip Cancellation, $7.5k Luggage).

Given the customer's specific concern about asthma ("I just panic thinking about needing a doctor over there") and their desire for "proper cover", the First tier provides the most comprehensive protection and highest limits, particularly for the vital pre-existing condition coverage. While Business offers a good balance, the superior limits of the First tier align best with the customer's need for robust medical security. Leisure Scuba Diving is typically covered under FWD policies as long as standard qualifications and depth limits are met (not listed under general exclusions for hazardous activities). The Pet Care add-on provides the requested clarification and coverage across all tiers.

Therefore, the First tier is recommended as it offers the highest level of protection, especially for the customer's primary concern regarding medical coverage for asthma (via the necessary add-on), and aligns best with the desire for comprehensive coverage, despite being the highest priced option. The No Mix-and-Match rule necessitates choosing the tier that best covers the *most critical* requirements comprehensively.
