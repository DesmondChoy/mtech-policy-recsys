**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO tiers for the customer's trip to Thailand:
*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable. Crucially, its Emergency Medical Evacuation benefit explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions like asthma (Section 4). Furthermore, it does not cover Leisure Underwater Activities (Section 28 N.A.), meaning Scuba Diving would not be covered.
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for travel to Japan and includes features like cashless medical services within Japan. As the customer is traveling to Thailand, this tier is inappropriate for their destination.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier covers the key requirements. It includes Medical Expenses Overseas ($300k limit) and Emergency Medical Evacuation (Unlimited limit for under 70s) which *does* provide cover for pre-existing conditions up to $100k (Section 4). It also covers Leisure Underwater Activities like Scuba Diving ($250k aggregate limit, Section 28). Trip Cancellation ($6k), Travel Delay ($1k max), and Lost/Damaged Luggage ($5k) are also included.
*   **Elite:** This tier also covers all key requirements, offering higher limits than Deluxe across the board (e.g., $1M Medical, $150k pre-existing evacuation limit, $350k Leisure Underwater Activities limit, $15k Trip Cancellation, $8k Luggage).

Both Deluxe and Elite meet the customer's essential requirements, including the critical need for medical evacuation covering asthma and coverage for Scuba Diving. Elite provides higher limits, but Deluxe provides sufficient coverage for all stated needs. Since both tiers adequately cover the core requirements, they can be considered equally suitable in meeting the minimum criteria. Applying the Tie-Breaking Rule (select the cheapest among equally suitable options based on the provided ranking: Vital < Deluxe < GO Japan! < Elite), the **Deluxe** tier is recommended. It provides the necessary coverage for the specific concerns (asthma evacuation, scuba diving) at a lower price point than the Elite tier. None of the tiers explicitly cover additional pet accommodation costs; the Travel Delay benefit provides a cash sum for inconvenience rather than specific expense reimbursement.
