**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers cover the customer's core requirements (Medical, Trip Cancellation, Travel Delay, Lost/Damaged Luggage) and the specific activity (Scuba Diving, assumed covered under standard medical/accident as not excluded). All tiers also offer the required 'Pet care' coverage as an *optional add-on*.

The key differences lie in the coverage limits:
*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Medical, $7.5k Cancellation, $3k Luggage). While meeting basic needs, it might not align with the customer's request for "comprehensive" coverage.
*   **Business:** Provides significantly higher limits than Premium (e.g., $500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage, Unlimited Evacuation). This offers a substantial level of protection suitable for a trip to Japan.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $7.5k Luggage, Unlimited Evacuation). While the most comprehensive, the limits might be higher than necessary for two healthy young adults on a 10-day trip, and it comes at the highest price point.

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. The Business tier strikes the best balance, providing robust, comprehensive limits that address the customer's stated needs without potentially excessive cost, unlike the First tier. It clearly surpasses the Premium tier in terms of coverage levels. The crucial pet accommodation requirement can be met by purchasing the available optional add-on with this tier.

Therefore, the Business tier is recommended as it provides comprehensive coverage with substantial limits across all requested areas, representing a better fit for the customer's needs than the lower-limit Premium tier and a more balanced value proposition than the higher-limit (and higher cost) First tier. The specific pet care need is addressed via an optional add-on available for this tier.
