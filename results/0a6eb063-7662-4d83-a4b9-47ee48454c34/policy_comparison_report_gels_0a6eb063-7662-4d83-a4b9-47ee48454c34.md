**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers against the customer's requirements for a comprehensive two-week trip to Australia including golf:

*   **Basic Tier:** Fails to meet key requirements. It explicitly excludes specific "Golfer's cover" (equipment, green fees, hole-in-one) and "Adventurous leisure activities" (potentially excluding hiking). It also lacks coverage for rental vehicle excess (relevant to golf buggy liability).
*   **Gold Tier:** Meets the core requirements (Medical $500k, Cancellation $10k, Delay $1.5k, Baggage $5k) and covers "Adventurous leisure activities" (hiking). It includes "Golfer's cover" with limits of $500 for equipment, $250 for green fees, and $250 for hole-in-one. It also covers "Rental vehicle excess" up to $1000, likely addressing the golf buggy liability concern.
*   **Platinum Tier:** Meets all requirements like the Gold tier but offers significantly higher limits (Medical $1M, Cancellation $15k, Delay $2k, Baggage $8k) and enhanced benefits. Crucially for this customer, it provides double the coverage for "Golfer's cover - equipment" ($1000 vs $500), includes specific "Sports equipment cover" ($1000), offers higher "Rental vehicle excess" ($1500 vs $1000), and has a shorter trigger time for delays (4 hours vs 6 hours).

Given the customer's request for "comprehensive" coverage, their specific concerns about expensive golf equipment, and the need to cover all listed activities and golf-related requests, the Platinum tier provides the best overall fit. The No Mix-and-Match rule prevents taking the cheaper Gold tier and supplementing its lower limits. While Gold meets the basic criteria, Platinum's higher limits and dedicated sports equipment cover offer a more robust and comprehensive solution aligned with the customer's stated needs and concerns. Therefore, Platinum is recommended over Gold.
