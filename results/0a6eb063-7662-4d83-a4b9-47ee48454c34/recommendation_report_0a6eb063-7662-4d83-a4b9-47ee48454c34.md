## Final Recommendation
Based on a detailed analysis of your requirements against available policies, the recommended policy is:

**GELS - Platinum**

### Justification
The recommended policy is gels Platinum. This decision is based on a comparative analysis against the other finalists, sompo Elite and fwd First, focusing on the comprehensive coverage required, particularly the specific golf-related needs.

Firstly, fwd First, despite offering high core limits (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation), is unsuitable because it fails to meet several critical golf-specific requirements. It lacks coverage for unused green fees, liability for rented golf buggy damage, and a hole-in-one benefit. Furthermore, its optional 'Sports equipment protector' add-on excludes damage occurring during play (Source: Page 29, What is not covered), a significant gap for an active golfer.

Comparing gels Platinum and sompo Elite, both offer strong core coverage and address most requirements. However, gels Platinum demonstrates key advantages:

1.  **Golf Equipment Coverage:** gels Platinum potentially offers superior protection for expensive golf equipment. It includes $1,000 under 'Golfer's cover' (Source: Page 5, Section 32) *plus* an additional $1,000 under a separate 'Sports equipment cover' (Source: Page 5, Section 33), unique to its Platinum tier. sompo Elite provides $1,000 specifically for golf equipment loss/damage under its 'Golf Cover' (Source: Page 6, Section 36) but lacks the additional sports equipment layer.
2.  **Hole-in-One Benefit:** While sompo Elite offers a higher limit ($500 vs. gels' $250), it is conditional upon achieving the hole-in-one 'during a competition' (Source: Page 6, Section 36). gels Platinum's $250 benefit (Source: Page 5, Section 32) does not specify this condition, making it more suitable for casual play.
3.  **Delay Triggers:** gels Platinum features shorter trigger times for both travel and baggage delays (4 hours vs. sompo's initial 6 hours), offering quicker access to benefits.
4.  **Buggy Liability/Damage:** sompo Elite explicitly covers 'Damage of buggy' up to $500 (Source: Page 6, Section 36). gels Platinum covers 'Rental vehicle excess' up to $1,500 (Source: Page 5, Section 31). While sompo's cover is more specific, gels' cover, assuming a golf buggy qualifies as a rental vehicle, offers a significantly higher limit, providing better protection against potentially expensive damage.

While sompo Elite has strengths like Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation (<70yrs) and explicit (though lower limit) buggy cover, gels Platinum's advantages in equipment protection, hole-in-one flexibility, delay triggers, and potentially higher buggy damage coverage align more closely with the need for comprehensive protection, especially considering the emphasis on golf. Therefore, gels Platinum is selected as the single best overall policy.
