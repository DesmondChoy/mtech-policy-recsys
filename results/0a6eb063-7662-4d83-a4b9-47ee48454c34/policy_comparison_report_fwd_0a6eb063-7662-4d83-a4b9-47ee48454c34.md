**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers against the customer's requirements: All tiers cover the core needs like Medical Emergencies, Trip Cancellation, Travel Delays, and Baggage Protection, with limits increasing from Premium to Business to First. Recreational hiking and golf participation are generally covered under the medical and personal accident sections of all tiers.

However, a critical point is the specific additional golf requirements: coverage for unused green fees, liability for rented golf buggy damage, and a hole-in-one benefit are **not covered by any FWD tier (Premium, Business, or First)**. Furthermore, while the optional 'Sports equipment protector' add-on (available for all tiers with the same $2,000 limit) covers loss, theft, or damage to golf equipment *in transit or storage*, it explicitly **excludes damage that occurs while the equipment is in use (during play)**.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. Since none of the FWD tiers can fully satisfy the specific golf requests, the decision rests on which tier best meets the core requirements and aligns with the customer's desire for "comprehensive" coverage and stated worries about medical issues and cancellations.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Medical, $7.5k Cancellation).
*   **Business:** Offers significantly higher limits (e.g., $500k Medical, $10k Cancellation) and includes Car Rental Excess (though unlikely applicable to golf buggies).
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits across the board (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $7.5k Baggage) and includes the highest Car Rental Excess limit ($1k).

Considering the customer's emphasis on comprehensive coverage and the fact that the main reason for the trip is golf (implying higher value placed on the trip experience), the **First** tier is recommended. Although it cannot meet all specific golf needs (a limitation shared across all FWD tiers), it provides the highest available limits for the core coverages (Medical, Cancellation, Baggage, Liability), offering the most robust protection available from FWD for the aspects it *does* cover. The optional 'Sports equipment protector' add-on would still be required to gain partial coverage for the golf clubs.
