**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, Elite) for the customer's trip to Australia, considering their comprehensive needs including specific golf requirements:

*   **Vital:** This tier offers the lowest coverage limits and, crucially, lacks specific coverage for amateur sports (which typically includes activities like golf and extensive hiking) and does not have the dedicated 'Golf Cover' section found in higher tiers. It fails to meet the customer's specific requests regarding golf equipment, unused green fees, buggy damage, and hole-in-one benefits.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier provides better core coverage limits than Vital and includes Amateur Sports Cover (covering hiking and general golf participation). However, its 'Golf Cover' section only addresses loss/damage to golf equipment ($500 limit) and explicitly marks unused green fees, buggy damage, and hole-in-one benefits as 'N.A.' (Not Applicable). It therefore only partially meets the golf-specific requirements.
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is unsuitable as it is specifically designed for travel to Japan, while the customer's destination is Australia.
*   **Elite:** This tier offers the highest limits for core coverage like medical expenses ($1M overseas) and trip cancellation ($15k). It includes Amateur Sports Cover for hiking and general golf participation. Most importantly, its dedicated 'Golf Cover' section (Section 36) specifically addresses *all* the customer's additional golf requests: loss/damage to equipment ($1000 limit), hole-in-one benefit ($500), reimbursement for unused green fees ($250), and liability for damage to a rented buggy ($500).

Given the customer's emphasis on comprehensive coverage, particularly the detailed golf-related needs, and the No Mix-and-Match rule preventing combining features from different tiers, the Elite tier is the only option that holistically meets all stated requirements. While it is the most expensive, its specific inclusions align directly with the customer's priorities, especially the extensive golf cover.

Therefore, the Elite tier is recommended as the single most suitable option, providing both high general coverage limits and the specific, detailed golf benefits requested by the customer.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides comprehensive coverage for all core requirements (Medical, Cancellation, Delay, Baggage) with high limits.
    *   Includes Amateur Sports Cover, explicitly covering hiking up to 3,500m and general golf participation.
    *   Uniquely among the suitable tiers, it offers a dedicated 'Golf Cover' section that addresses *all* the customer's specific golf-related requests: equipment loss/damage ($1000), unused green fees ($250), buggy damage liability ($500), and a hole-in-one benefit ($500).
    *   Offers Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for travellers under 70.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Potential Hole-in-one Benefit: The $500 benefit is only payable if the hole-in-one is achieved during a competition, which may not align with the customer's plans for casual play.
    *   Golf Equipment Coverage: While coverage is provided, the $1000 limit for loss/damage might be insufficient if the customer's golf clubs are particularly high-value.
