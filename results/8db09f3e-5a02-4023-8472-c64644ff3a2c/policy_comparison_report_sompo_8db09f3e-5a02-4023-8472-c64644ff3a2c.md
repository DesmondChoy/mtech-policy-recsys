**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO Vital, Deluxe, and Elite tiers against the customer's requirements for a golfing trip to Australia:
*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable. It lacks any specific golf coverage (equipment, green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one). Furthermore, it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under the Emergency Medical Evacuation benefit, which is a key concern for the customer (high blood pressure). Coverage for amateur sports like hiking is also not explicitly mentioned or included as it is in higher tiers.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier offers partial coverage. It includes Amateur Sports Cover (covering light hiking) and provides some coverage for pre-existing conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation ($100k limit). It has a 'Golf Cover' section, but only covers loss/damage to equipment ($500 limit) and explicitly states Hole-in-one, Unused Green Fees, and Damage of Buggy are 'N.A.' (Not Applicable). This fails to meet several of the customer's specific additional requests related to golf.
*   **Elite:** This tier provides the most comprehensive coverage aligned with the customer's needs. It includes Amateur Sports Cover (covering light hiking) and offers the highest available limit for pre-existing conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation ($150k limit). Crucially, its 'Golf Cover' section addresses *all* the customer's specific requests: loss/damage to equipment ($1000 limit), hole-in-one benefit ($500), unused green fees ($250), and damage to rented buggies ($500). It also offers the highest limits for core benefits like Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), and Baggage ($8k).

Given the customer's specific and numerous requirements related to golf, the concern about pre-existing conditions (addressed best by Elite's evacuation cover), and the No Mix-and-Match rule requiring a single tier to meet all needs, the Elite tier is the only option that holistically covers the stated requirements. Although it is the most expensive, its comprehensive nature, particularly the specific golf benefits absent in other tiers, makes it the most suitable choice. The Tie-Breaking Rule was not needed as Elite provides significantly better alignment with the requirements than the cheaper tiers.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides comprehensive and specific coverage for all requested golf-related needs (equipment, unused green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one).
    *   Offers the highest limits for core coverage areas like medical expenses, trip cancellation, and baggage.
    *   Includes Amateur Sports Cover, explicitly covering activities like light hiking (trekking up to 3500m).
    *   Provides the highest available coverage limit ($150k for under 70s) for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions among the suitable tiers.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Pre-existing Conditions: While evacuation is covered up to a limit, general medical treatment for pre-existing conditions (like high blood pressure) is likely excluded unless specific stability criteria are met (this is a standard industry exclusion but remains a potential gap).
    *   Golf Equipment Limit: The $1000 limit for loss/damage might be insufficient for very high-value golf clubs.
    *   Unused Green Fees Limit: The $250 limit might not cover the full cost of green fees at expensive courses.
    *   Hole-in-One: Benefit likely requires play during an official competition (based on typical policy wording, though not explicitly stated in the snippet).
