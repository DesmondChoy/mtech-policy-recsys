**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for this customer: All tiers require the purchase of optional add-ons for 'Pre-existing medical conditions' coverage and 'Sports equipment protector' to address the customer's core needs. None of the tiers or add-ons specifically cover unused green fees, accidental damage to rented golf buggies, or provide a hole-in-one benefit. The 'Sports equipment protector' add-on, necessary for golf club coverage in all tiers, also explicitly excludes damage occurring while the equipment is in use.

Given these limitations are consistent across tiers, the decision hinges on the level of coverage for the pre-existing condition (high blood pressure) and core benefits like medical expenses, trip cancellation, and baggage. The First tier offers significantly higher limits in these critical areas compared to Premium and Business. For instance, under the 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on, First provides S$150k for overseas medical and S$150k for evacuation, compared to S$100k/S$100k for Business and S$50k(50% co-pay)/Unlimited for Premium. Similarly, base Trip Cancellation is S$15k (First) vs S$10k (Business) vs S$7.5k (Premium), and base Overseas Medical is S$1M (First) vs S$500k (Business) vs S$200k (Premium).

Considering the customer's age group, the presence of a pre-existing condition, the specific concern about cancellation/medical issues related to it, and the No Mix-and-Match rule (requiring selection of a single tier), the First tier provides the most robust protection despite being the most expensive. The higher limits offer greater peace of mind and better align with potential costs associated with medical events or major trip disruptions overseas, outweighing the lower limits of the cheaper Premium and Business tiers, especially since the specific golf benefits are unmet across all options.

## Detailed Coverage Analysis for Recommended Tier: First
