**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for this customer: All tiers offer core coverage for medical, cancellation, delay, and luggage, but differ significantly in limits. Crucially, addressing the customer's pre-existing asthma requires purchasing the optional 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on, available across all tiers but with varying medical limits (First: $150k, Business: $100k, Premium: $50k + Unlimited Evac). Similarly, the specific concern about cancelling due to a sister's wedding date change necessitates the 'Cancel for any reason' (CFAR) add-on, also available for all tiers (if purchased within 7 days of deposit). However, the CFAR reimbursement limits (at 50% of costs) vary drastically: First ($6,000), Business ($3,000), and Premium ($1,000).

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier with the necessary add-ons. Premium, while cheapest, offers very low limits for both the CFAR ($1k) and pre-existing medical ($50k) coverages, likely insufficient for the stated concerns and trip costs. Business offers moderate limits ($3k CFAR, $100k pre-ex medical). First provides the highest limits across the board, including the highest CFAR limit ($6k) which best addresses the significant wedding cancellation worry, the highest pre-existing medical coverage ($150k), and the highest general medical ($1M), luggage ($7.5k), and delay ($1k) benefits, suitable for travel to Japan and participation in activities like hiking and hot air ballooning.

Although the First tier is the most expensive and likely exceeds the customer's preferred budget of $200-$300 (especially with two add-ons for two people), it is the only tier that comprehensively addresses the customer's specific high-priority requirements (wedding cancellation, asthma) with robust coverage limits, providing the greatest peace of mind. Therefore, the First tier is recommended as the most suitable option based on the required coverage depth.

### Requirement: pre_existing_conditions (asthma)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Pre-existing medical conditions (Optional Add-on)

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met: Requires purchase of the 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on. Provides high limits ($150k Medical, $150k Evac) for events arising from asthma.

### Requirement: additional_requests (Budget preference $200-$300)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Not Applicable (Relates to premium cost)
    *   **Base Limits:** Not Applicable
    *   **Conditional Limits:** Not Applicable
    *   **Source Specific Details:** Not Applicable
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Not Met: The First tier is the highest priced FWD tier. The premium for two adults for two weeks, especially including the necessary 'Pre-existing medical conditions' and 'Cancel for any reason' add-ons, is highly likely to exceed the $300 upper limit of the customer's preferred budget.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: First

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Highest overall limits for core benefits (Medical $1M, Cancellation $15k, Luggage $7.5k, Delay $1k).
    *   Highest limit ($6k) for the crucial 'Cancel for any reason' add-on, best addressing the specific wedding cancellation concern (though only 50% reimbursement applies).
    *   Highest limit ($150k Medical, $150k Evac) for the 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on, providing robust cover for asthma.
    *   Unlimited base medical evacuation.
    *   High limits provide good coverage for potential incidents during hiking and hot air ballooning.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip Cancellation (Sister's Wedding): Requires the 'Cancel for any reason' add-on (must be bought within 7 days of deposit) and only reimburses 50% of costs up to the $6k limit. Standard cancellation is unlikely to cover this specific reason.
    *   Budget Preference ($200-$300): This tier, being the most comprehensive and requiring two add-ons, will likely exceed the customer's preferred budget.
    *   Requires purchase of two separate optional add-ons ('Pre-existing medical conditions' and 'Cancel for any reason') to meet key requirements.
