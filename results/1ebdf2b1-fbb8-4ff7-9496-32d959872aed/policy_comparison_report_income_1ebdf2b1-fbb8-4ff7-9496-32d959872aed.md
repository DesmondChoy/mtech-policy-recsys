**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All tiers cover the core requirements like medical emergencies (excluding pre-existing conditions), standard trip cancellation, travel delay, luggage loss/damage, and the specified activities (hiking, hot air ballooning). However, they differ significantly in coverage limits.

*   **Classic:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $250k Medical Overseas, $5k Cancellation, $3k Luggage). While likely meeting the budget, these limits might be insufficient given the customer's expressed anxieties and destination. Medical evacuation is capped at $500k (under 70).
*   **Deluxe:** Provides a substantial increase in limits over Classic (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage) and offers Unlimited Medical Evacuation (for under 70s). This offers significantly better protection for major events. It represents a good balance between enhanced coverage and potential budget alignment.
*   **Preferred:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage) and Unlimited Medical Evacuation (for under 70s). While providing the most coverage, it likely exceeds the customer's $200-$300 budget preference and still doesn't cover the specific exclusions mentioned below.

**Crucial Exclusions:**
1.  **Pre-existing Conditions (Asthma):** None of the standard tiers (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred) cover pre-existing medical conditions like asthma. This is a significant gap.
2.  **Specific Cancellation Reason (Sister's Wedding):** Trip cancellation due to a change in a sister's wedding date is *highly unlikely* to be covered under the standard "unforeseen circumstances" definition in any tier. Coverage typically requires events like serious illness/death of the insured, travel companion, or a close relative.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. While no tier perfectly meets *all* requirements due to the standard exclusions for pre-existing conditions and the specific cancellation scenario, the **Deluxe** tier is recommended. It offers a significant upgrade in protection limits compared to Classic, particularly for major medical events (including unlimited evacuation for under 70s), which aligns better with the customer's concerns about things going wrong, while being more likely to be closer to the budget than the Preferred tier. The customer MUST be aware that the asthma and the specific wedding-related cancellation scenario are likely not covered.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Deluxe

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides significantly higher limits than Classic for key coverages like Medical Overseas ($500k vs $250k), Trip Cancellation ($10k vs $5k), and Luggage ($5k vs $3k).
    *   Offers Unlimited Medical Evacuation for travelers under 70, a major advantage over Classic's $500k limit.
    *   Fully covers the requested activities (hiking, hot air ballooning) under the Adventurous Activities clause.
    *   Covers core requirements like travel delay and standard luggage issues.
    *   Represents a good balance between enhanced protection and potential budget alignment compared to Classic and Preferred.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Pre-existing Conditions (Asthma): Explicitly excluded from coverage under this standard plan.
    *   Specific Trip Cancellation Reason: Cancellation due to a sister's wedding date change is highly unlikely to be covered.
    *   Budget: While potentially closer than Preferred, the actual premium might still exceed the $200-$300 preference (requires quote).
