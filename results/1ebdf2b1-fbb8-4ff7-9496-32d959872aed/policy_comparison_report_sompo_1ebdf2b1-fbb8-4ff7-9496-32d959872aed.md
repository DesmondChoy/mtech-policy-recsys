**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a two-week trip to Japan for two adults:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable. It lacks coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under the Emergency Medical Evacuation benefit (Section 4: N.A.), failing the customer's requirement regarding asthma. Furthermore, it does not explicitly mention coverage for the requested activities (hiking, hot air ballooning) under its Amateur Sports cover (Page 2/5: Not Applicable/Mentioned).
*   **Deluxe:** This tier meets several core requirements. It provides Medical Expenses cover ($300k), Emergency Evacuation including for pre-existing conditions ($100k limit), Trip Cancellation ($6k), Travel Delay ($1k max), Luggage ($5k), and explicitly covers Hot Air Ballooning and Trekking up to 3,500m (hiking). It is the second cheapest option.
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier builds upon Deluxe, offering significantly higher Overseas Medical Expenses cover ($500k vs $300k) and includes Japan-specific benefits like cashless medical services at numerous clinics/hospitals and a dedicated assistance hotline (EAJ). It shares the same limits as Deluxe for Pre-existing Condition Evacuation ($100k), Trip Cancellation ($6k), Travel Delay ($1k max), Luggage ($5k), and also covers the specified activities (Hot Air Ballooning, Trekking up to 3,500m). It is priced higher than Deluxe but lower than Elite.
*   **Elite:** This tier offers the highest limits across most categories (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $150k Pre-existing Evac limit, $8k Luggage, $2k Travel Delay) and covers the activities. However, it is the most expensive tier and likely exceeds the customer's budget preference of $200-$300.

**Reasoning for Recommendation:**

The customer expressed significant concern about potential medical costs in Japan ("huge", "keeps me up at night") and has a pre-existing condition (asthma). While Deluxe meets the minimum requirements, the **GO Japan!** tier is recommended because:
1.  It offers a substantially higher Overseas Medical Expenses limit ($500k vs $300k in Deluxe), providing greater peace of mind given the customer's anxiety.
2.  It includes Japan-specific cashless medical services and a dedicated assistance hotline (EAJ), which adds significant convenience and support directly relevant to the travel destination.
3.  It covers the pre-existing condition (asthma) for Emergency Medical Evacuation (up to $100k, same as Deluxe).
4.  It explicitly covers the requested activities (hiking/trekking up to 3,500m and hot air ballooning).
5.  It provides adequate coverage for trip cancellation ($6k), travel delay ($1k max), and luggage ($5k).

Although GO Japan! is more expensive than Deluxe and might slightly exceed the lower end of the budget preference, the enhanced medical coverage and Japan-specific features directly address the customer's primary concerns more effectively than Deluxe. Elite offers even higher limits but is likely too costly based on the stated budget preference. The specific trip cancellation scenario (sister's wedding date change) is highly unlikely to be covered under standard terms in *any* tier, so this doesn't differentiate the suitable options. Therefore, GO Japan! represents the best balance of comprehensive, relevant coverage and value for this specific customer and trip.

If initial treatment was not sought overseas, treatment in Singapore must be sought within 48 hours from return date and covered for up to 31 days.', 'source_location': 'Page 3, Section 3'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Meets general medical needs with good limits ($500k overseas) and covers pre-existing conditions for evacuation up to a sub-limit ($100k). The assessment is 'Partially Met' only because pre-existing conditions have a sub-limit for evacuation, not unlimited cover.

### Requirement: trip cancellation

*   **Policy Coverage:** Trip Cancellation or Postponement
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person', 'limit': 6000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 10000, 'basis': None}]

Includes coverage for loss of frequent flyer or similar travel points used to purchase an airline ticket.', 'source_location': 'Page 4, Section 13 & Page 2, Trip Cancellation or Postponement'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Provides $6,000 coverage per person for cancellation due to standard "Insured Events". However, the specific scenario requested (sister's wedding date change) is highly unlikely to be considered a standard Insured Event and is therefore likely not covered.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met: Explicitly covers Hot Air Ballooning and Trekking up to 3,500m (hiking).

### Requirement: additional_requests

*   **Policy Coverage:** Trip Cancellation or Postponement
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person', 'limit': 6000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 10000, 'basis': None}]

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Addresses the budget preference by being a mid-range plan (likely closer to the $200-$300 range than Elite, though potentially slightly above Deluxe which might be cheaper). However, as noted under 'trip cancellation', the specific concern about cancelling due to a sister's wedding date change is highly unlikely to be covered under the standard "Insured Events".

## Summary for Recommended Tier: GO Japan!

*   **Strengths:**
    *   High Overseas Medical Expenses limit ($500,000 per person under 70), addressing customer's key concern.
    *   Includes Japan-specific cashless medical services and assistance hotline (EAJ).
    *   Explicitly covers requested activities: Hiking (Trekking up to 3,500m) and Hot Air Ballooning.
    *   Provides coverage for Emergency Medical Evacuation due to pre-existing conditions (asthma) up to $100,000 (per person under 70).
    *   Comprehensive travel inconvenience benefits (delay, luggage, etc.).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip Cancellation: The specific reason requested (sister's wedding date change clashing with trip) is highly unlikely to be covered under standard policy terms.
    *   Pre-existing Conditions: Emergency Medical Evacuation has a sub-limit ($100k), and overseas medical treatment for non-emergency pre-existing conditions is typically excluded.
    *   Budget: May be at the higher end or slightly exceed the customer's preferred $200-$300 budget range (though likely less expensive than the Elite tier).
