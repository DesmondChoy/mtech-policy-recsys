**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, and Elite tiers for the customer's trip to Japan:

1.  **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it lacks specific coverage for amateur sports like skiing (Page 2 Highlights & Page 5 Section 28) and explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation (Page 3, Section 4), failing two key customer requirements.
2.  **Deluxe:** Covers skiing (Page 2, Amateur Sports Cover) and provides limited coverage for pre-existing conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation ($100k limit, Page 3, Section 4). It meets the basic requirements for luggage, delay, and cancellation. However, its overseas medical limit ($300k) is lower than GO Japan! and Elite, and it lacks Japan-specific benefits.
3.  **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for travel to Japan. It covers skiing (Page 2, Amateur Sports Cover) and includes limited pre-existing condition coverage for Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation ($100k limit, Page 3, Section 4). It offers a higher overseas medical limit ($500k) than Deluxe and includes valuable Japan-specific features like cashless medical services at numerous clinics/hospitals and a dedicated 24-Hour Medical Assistance hotline in Japan (Page 2). It covers luggage, delay, and cancellation similarly to Deluxe.
4.  **Elite:** Offers the highest limits across most categories (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage, $150k Pre-existing Evac limit) and covers skiing (Page 2, Amateur Sports Cover). While providing the most comprehensive limits, it is the most expensive tier and lacks the Japan-specific cashless service offered by GO Japan!.

**Conclusion:** The Vital tier is eliminated. Deluxe, GO Japan!, and Elite all cover skiing and offer limited pre-existing condition coverage (evacuation/repatriation only, likely not treatment costs for asthma based on typical policy structures and the provided JSON details). Given the destination is Japan, the **GO Japan!** tier provides the best balance. It meets the core requirements (skiing, luggage, delay, cancellation, limited pre-existing condition evacuation), offers a substantial medical limit ($500k), and includes highly relevant Japan-specific benefits (cashless medical, local assistance hotline). While Elite offers higher limits, GO Japan! is likely more aligned with the customer's potential budget sensitivity (being cheaper than Elite) and provides practical advantages for the specific destination. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose one package, and GO Japan! offers the most tailored and practical feature set for this trip compared to Deluxe and Elite.

*Note:* The critical point regarding pre-existing asthma is that while GO Japan! (like Deluxe and Elite) covers *emergency evacuation/repatriation* related to it, the provided details do not confirm coverage for *overseas medical treatment costs* for an asthma flare-up under Section 2. This is a significant potential gap that should be clarified with the insurer. Similarly, trip cancellation for a sister's wedding is highly unlikely to be covered under standard "Insured Events" and requires clarification.

Includes coverage for loss of frequent flyer or similar travel points used to purchase an airline ticket.', 'source_location': 'Page 4, Section 13 & Page 2, Trip Cancellation or Postponement'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Covers trip cancellation up to $6,000 per person for standard "Insured Events" (typically serious illness, injury, death, travel advisories, etc.). The specific request regarding cancellation due to a sister's wedding needs clarification, as personal events/choices are usually *not* covered Insured Events.

### Requirement: pre_existing_conditions (asthma)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation (Including Mortal Remains) Back to Singapore
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person - up to 70 years (Pre-existing Conditions)', 'limit': 100000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - above 70 years (Pre-existing Conditions)', 'limit': 50000, 'basis': None}]

    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [Details listed under Medical Coverage section above do *not* explicitly mention coverage for pre-existing conditions for standard medical treatment.]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Provides coverage for Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation related to pre-existing conditions up to $100,000 (for age <70). However, the policy details provided do not indicate that standard overseas medical *treatment* costs (Section 2) for pre-existing conditions like asthma are covered. This is a significant limitation.

### Requirement: activities_to_cover (skiing)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Personal Accident
    *   **Base Limits:** [See Skiing Coverage section above]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Coverage includes amateur sports like tandem skydiving, hang-gliding, paragliding, snow-skiing, hot-air ballooning, bungee jumping, indoor rock climbing and trekking up to 3,500m above sea level for all mountains.', 'source_location': 'Page 2, Amateur Sports Cover'}]
*   **Policy Coverage:** Medical Expenses Incurred Overseas
    *   **Base Limits:** [See Skiing Coverage section above]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Coverage includes medical expenses arising from amateur sports like tandem skydiving, hang-gliding, paragliding, snow-skiing, hot-air ballooning, bungee jumping, indoor rock climbing and trekking up to 3,500m above sea level for all mountains.', 'source_location': 'Page 2, Amateur Sports Cover'}]

### Requirement: additional_requests (Clarification on trip cancellation due to a sister's wedding)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Trip Cancellation or Postponement
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person', 'limit': 6000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 10000, 'basis': None}]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Covers non-refundable travel expenses if trip is cancelled or postponed due to Insured Events occurring within 30 days before departure. Includes coverage for loss of frequent flyer or similar travel points used to purchase an airline ticket.', 'source_location': 'Page 4, Section 13 & Page 2, Trip Cancellation or Postponement'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Not Met: The policy covers cancellation due to defined "Insured Events". Cancellation due to a change of plans for a family wedding is typically considered a personal choice and is highly unlikely to be listed as a covered Insured Event in the full policy wording. Clarification should be sought from the insurer, but the customer should expect this reason not to be covered.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: GO Japan!

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Specifically tailored for Japan travel with cashless medical services and local assistance hotline.
    *   Provides coverage for the required activity: skiing.
    *   Covers core needs like lost/damaged luggage and travel delays adequately.
    *   Offers a good level of overseas medical coverage ($500k).
    *   Includes Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation coverage for pre-existing conditions (up to $100k limit).
    *   Likely more budget-friendly than the highest tier (Elite).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   **Pre-existing Conditions (Asthma):** Overseas medical *treatment* costs for asthma are likely *not* covered under Section 2 based on provided details; only Emergency Evacuation/Repatriation (Section 4) explicitly mentions pre-existing condition coverage (Partially Met).
    *   **Trip Cancellation:** While standard cancellation is covered, the specific reason requested (sister's wedding) is highly unlikely to be a covered "Insured Event" (Partially Met / Not Met for specific reason).
