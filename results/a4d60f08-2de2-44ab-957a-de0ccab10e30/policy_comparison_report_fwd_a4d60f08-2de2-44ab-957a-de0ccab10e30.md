**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for this customer traveling to Japan with specific needs for medical cover (asthma), skiing, luggage, delays, and trip cancellation (sister's wedding):

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits for medical ($200k base, $50k pre-existing add-on), luggage ($3k), travel delay ($300), and trip cancellation ($7.5k base). The crucial 'Cancel for any reason' add-on limit is only $1k (50% reimbursement). While the cheapest, these limits may be insufficient given the pre-existing condition, skiing activity, and potential trip cost.
*   **Business:** Provides a significant step up in coverage: $500k base medical ($100k pre-existing add-on), $5k luggage, $500 travel delay, and $10k base trip cancellation. The 'Cancel for any reason' add-on limit is $3k (50% reimbursement), offering better protection for the wedding cancellation scenario. It offers a strong balance of coverage for all requirements.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits ($1M base medical, $150k pre-existing add-on; $7.5k luggage; $1k travel delay; $15k base cancellation; $6k 'Cancel for any reason' add-on). While providing the most coverage, it is also the most expensive tier, potentially exceeding the customer's needs and implied budget sensitivity.

**Decision:** All tiers require the 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on for asthma coverage and the 'Cancel for any reason' add-on for potential wedding cancellation coverage (subject to its terms). Leisure skiing injuries are typically covered under standard medical/accident benefits in all tiers. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose one tier package.

The **Business** tier is recommended because it offers substantially higher and more appropriate limits than the Premium tier for the customer's key concerns (medical cover including pre-existing asthma, potential cancellation due to wedding via the CFAR add-on) and other requirements like luggage and delays. It provides a robust level of protection suitable for travel to Japan involving skiing and a pre-existing condition, representing a better holistic fit than Premium without the potentially unnecessary expense of the First tier.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Business

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides robust medical coverage ($500k base) suitable for Japan and activities like skiing.
    *   Offers good coverage ($100k) for pre-existing conditions (asthma) via the necessary add-on.
    *   Unlimited emergency medical evacuation (base policy).
    *   Offers higher limits for luggage ($5k) and travel delay ($500) compared to the Premium tier.
    *   Includes a 'Cancel for any reason' add-on option with a reasonable limit ($3k, 50% reimbursement) which can address the specific wedding cancellation concern.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Requires purchase of the 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on for asthma-related claims.
    *   Trip cancellation due to sister's wedding is not covered under the base policy and requires the 'Cancel for any reason' add-on, which only provides 50% reimbursement up to $3,000 and must be purchased within 7 days of the initial trip deposit.
    *   Emergency medical evacuation limit is reduced to $100k (from Unlimited) if the evacuation is required due to the pre-existing condition covered by the add-on.
