**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers, all offer base coverage for the customer's core needs like Trip Cancellation, Medical Expenses, Luggage issues, and Travel Delays. However, coverage for the pre-existing condition (High blood pressure) and Pet Accommodation Costs requires purchasing optional add-ons regardless of the chosen tier. Hiking is generally covered as a leisure activity across all tiers, assuming it's non-extreme.

The key differentiators are the coverage limits, particularly for the areas the customer expressed most concern about: comprehensive medical coverage and the pre-existing condition.
*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits overall. Critically, its 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on only covers S$50,000 for overseas medical expenses *with a 50% co-payment*, which may not meet the customer's need for "comprehensive" coverage given their specific worry.
*   **Business:** Provides significantly higher limits than Premium, including S$100,000 for overseas medical expenses under the pre-existing condition add-on (with no mention of co-payment for this specific benefit in the provided data) and S$100,000 for related evacuation. Base medical is S$500,000.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits across all categories. The 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on provides S$150,000 for overseas medical expenses (no co-payment mentioned for this benefit) and S$150,000 for related evacuation. Base medical is S$1,000,000, and Trip Cancellation is S$15,000 (also S$15,000 under the pre-ex add-on with 50% co-pay).

Given the customer's emphasis on "comprehensive" coverage, specific worry about the pre-existing condition (High blood pressure), and flexible budget ("The most important thing is feeling secure"), the **First** tier is the most suitable. Although it is the most expensive, its significantly higher limits for both base medical/cancellation and, crucially, for the required pre-existing condition add-on benefits (Medical Expenses, Evacuation, Cancellation), provide the highest level of security and best address the customer's primary concerns. The 'Pet Care' add-on must be purchased separately with any tier. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must select the entire First tier package to get these higher limits.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met (Requires purchase of the optional 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on. Provides coverage up to specified limits for relevant benefits like Medical Expenses, Evacuation, Cancellation, Disruption etc., arising from the declared condition. Note the 50% co-payment for cancellation/disruption related benefits).

### Requirement: Hiking

*   **Policy Coverage:** General Policy Terms / Exclusions
    *   **Base Limits:** Not Applicable
    *   **Conditional Limits:** Not Applicable
    *   **Source Specific Details:** Standard leisure hiking is typically covered. Policies usually exclude professional sports, extreme/hazardous activities, or activities against local regulations/medical advice. (Specific exclusion details are in the General Exclusions section, typically pages 31-35, which were not fully provided but standard policy wordings cover leisure hiking). FWD policy wording generally covers leisure participation in sports and activities unless specifically excluded or falling under general exclusions like hazardous activities. Day hiking as described is unlikely to be excluded.
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met (Assuming non-professional, non-extreme day hiking as stated by the customer).

### Requirement: Additional accommodation and meal costs during significant travel delays.

*   **Policy Coverage:** Travel delay
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Person (Overseas Delay)', 'limit': 1000, 'basis': 'S$100 for every six hours delay while overseas'}, {'type': 'Per Person (Singapore Delay)', 'limit': 100, 'basis': 'S$100 for the first six hours delay in Singapore only'}]

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: The standard 'Travel Delay' benefit provides a fixed cash amount per 6-hour delay, not direct reimbursement for accommodation/meals. The 'Trip Disruption' benefit may cover additional accommodation costs, but only if the delay is due to specific covered reasons that force an itinerary change (like illness, specific flight cancellations), not just waiting for a delayed flight.
