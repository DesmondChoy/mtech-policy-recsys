**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements reveals significant differences, particularly regarding pre-existing conditions and overall coverage limits.

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under the Emergency Medical Evacuation benefit (Section 4) and offers the lowest overall limits, failing to meet the customer's need for comprehensive coverage and security regarding the high blood pressure concern. Hiking coverage is also not explicitly mentioned.
*   **Deluxe & GO Japan!:** Both tiers offer identical, moderate coverage levels for Trip Cancellation ($6k) and Baggage ($5k). They cover Hiking up to 3,500m and provide Emergency Medical Evacuation cover for pre-existing conditions up to $100k. GO Japan! offers higher overseas medical ($500k vs $300k for Deluxe) and Japan-specific cashless services, making it slightly better than Deluxe for this destination. However, neither tier addresses the Pet Accommodation requirement, and Travel Delay coverage is a cash benefit ($1k max) which may not fully cover actual additional accommodation/meal costs.
*   **Elite:** This tier provides the highest limits across all key areas: Medical ($1M Overseas), Trip Cancellation ($15k), Baggage ($8k), and crucially, Emergency Medical Evacuation for pre-existing conditions ($150k). It also covers Hiking up to 3,500m. While it shares the same gaps as Deluxe and GO Japan! regarding Pet Accommodation (not covered) and Travel Delay (cash benefit only, $2k max), its significantly higher limits align best with the customer's stated priority for comprehensive coverage and security, especially concerning potential medical events related to the pre-existing condition.

Given the customer's flexible budget, emphasis on security, and specific concerns about comprehensive medical coverage including the pre-existing condition, the Elite tier is recommended. Although no tier perfectly meets *all* requirements (specifically Pet Accommodation and direct reimbursement for delay-related accommodation/meals), Elite provides the most robust protection for the prioritized needs within the SOMPO options, adhering to the No Mix-and-Match rule.
