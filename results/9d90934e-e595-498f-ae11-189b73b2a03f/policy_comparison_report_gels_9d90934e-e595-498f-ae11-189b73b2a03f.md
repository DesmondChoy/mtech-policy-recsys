**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** Fails to meet several critical customer requirements. It explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions (like high blood pressure), does not cover Pet Accommodation Costs, and does not cover adventurous leisure activities like Hiking.
*   **Gold:** Meets all core requirements. It offers substantial limits for Trip Cancellation (S$10,000 pp) and Comprehensive Medical Coverage (S$500,000 pp). Crucially, it allows the purchase of an **optional Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit**, which is essential for the customer's high blood pressure concern. It also specifically covers Lost/Damaged/Delayed Luggage, Travel Delays (cash benefit S$100/6hrs, plus Trip Disruption for accommodation/meals), Pet Accommodation Costs (S$500), and Hiking under Adventurous leisure activities.
*   **Platinum:** Also meets all core requirements and offers higher limits than Gold (e.g., S$1M Medical, S$15k Cancellation, S$800 Pet Care, faster Travel Delay payout). It also requires the purchase of the **optional Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit**.

While Platinum offers higher limits, the Gold tier successfully covers *all* the specific types of coverage requested by the customer, including the essential pre-existing condition coverage (via the add-on), pet care, and hiking. Both Gold and Platinum provide a comprehensive solution addressing the customer's worries. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. Since both Gold and Platinum meet the functional requirements (when the necessary add-on is included), they are considered equally suitable in terms of covering the *types* of risks identified. Applying the Tie-Breaking Rule (select the cheapest among equally suitable options), the Gold tier is recommended over the Platinum tier.
