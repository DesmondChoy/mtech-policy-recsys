**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the available SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a comprehensive 3-week trip to Europe:

*   **GO Japan!** is immediately unsuitable due to the destination requirement (Europe).
*   **Vital** offers the lowest coverage limits and explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation (Section 4), making it unsuitable for the customer's high blood pressure requirement. It also lacks specific Amateur Sports Cover, meaning white water rafting would likely be excluded, and does not mention double indemnity.
*   **Deluxe** provides higher limits than Vital and includes coverage for pre-existing conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation (up to $100k, Section 4). It includes Amateur Sports Cover, but white water rafting is not explicitly listed, making coverage uncertain. It does not offer trip cancellation for 'any reason' or the requested double indemnity benefit.
*   **Elite** offers the highest coverage limits across all major categories (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Trip Cancellation, $8k Baggage, $500k Personal Accident). It provides the highest sub-limit for pre-existing conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation ($150k, Section 4), offering the best available option within SOMPO for this need, although general medical treatment for the condition might still be excluded or limited. Like Deluxe, its Amateur Sports Cover doesn't explicitly list white water rafting. Crucially, it also fails to meet the specific requirements for 'trip cancellation for any reason' and 'double indemnity for accidental death on public transport', as these features are not offered in this standard tier.

Despite no tier perfectly matching *all* requirements (particularly the niche 'Cancellation for Any Reason' and 'Double Indemnity' requests, and the uncertain rafting cover), the customer prioritizes the "best coverage", "top-tier service", and has a "flexible budget". The **Elite** tier aligns best with this priority by offering the most comprehensive coverage and highest limits available from SOMPO. While gaps remain, it provides the strongest foundation compared to Vital and Deluxe. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose the single tier that best approximates their needs, and Elite is the closest fit among the SOMPO options presented.

## Detailed Coverage Analysis for Recommended Tier: Elite

### Requirement: Medical coverage for high blood pressure

*   **Policy Coverage:** Medical Expenses Incurred Overseas
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person - 70 years & below', 'limit': 1000000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - Over 70 years', 'limit': 100000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 1200000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Physiotherapist, Chinese Physician or Chiropractor', 'limit': 300, 'basis': '$50 per visit'}, {'type': 'Dentist', 'limit': 500, 'basis': None}]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Covers outpatient and hospitalisation medical expenses incurred overseas arising from accident or sickness, emergency dental expenses arising from accident, and accidental miscarriage. Includes treatment by specified practitioners.', 'source_location': 'Page 3, Section 2'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Overseas coverage up to $1,000,000, including Chinese Physicians and Chiropractors.', 'source_location': 'Page 2, Overseas Medical Expenses Highlight'}]
*   **Policy Coverage:** Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation (Including Mortal Remains) Back to Singapore
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person - up to 70 years', 'limit': 'Unlimited', 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - above 70 years', 'limit': 150000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - up to 70 years (Pre-existing Conditions)', 'limit': 150000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - above 70 years (Pre-existing Conditions)', 'limit': 75000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 'No aggregate limit', 'basis': None}]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Covers costs for emergency medical evacuation or repatriation of mortal remains back to Singapore. Includes pregnancy-related complications and pre-existing medical conditions subject to specific limits.', 'source_location': 'Page 3, Section 4'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Includes pregnancy-related complications and pre-existing medical conditions.', 'source_location': 'Page 2, Medical Evacuation & Repatriation Highlight'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation explicitly covers pre-existing conditions up to $150,000 for under 70s. However, general Medical Expenses Overseas (Section 2) typically exclude pre-existing conditions unless specifically stated otherwise in the policy document's main exclusions or definitions, which are not fully detailed here. Coverage for general treatment related to high blood pressure is therefore uncertain or likely excluded under Section 2.
