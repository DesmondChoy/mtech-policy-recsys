**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for this customer:
*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits across key areas like Medical ($200k base, $50k pre-existing add-on), Cancellation ($7.5k), and Luggage ($3k). While it covers the basic requirements and allows for the necessary Pet Care and Pre-existing Condition add-ons, the limits, especially for pre-existing medical cover, may be insufficient for a 3-week trip to Europe, contradicting the need for "comprehensive" coverage.
*   **Business:** Provides significantly better limits than Premium (Medical $500k base, $100k pre-existing add-on; Cancellation $10k; Luggage $5k) and includes Car Rental Excess cover. It represents a good balance but still falls short of the First tier's limits, particularly for pre-existing condition medical cover ($100k vs $150k).
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits across all major categories (Medical $1M base, $150k pre-existing add-on; Cancellation $15k; Luggage $7.5k; Travel Delay $1k overseas) and includes Car Rental Excess.

The customer requires "comprehensive" coverage, specifically needs cover for a pre-existing condition (High Blood Pressure), wants protection against "significant delays", needs pet accommodation cover, and has a "flexible budget" while expecting "top-tier service". The No Mix-and-Match rule means the chosen tier must meet all needs adequately.

Therefore, the **First** tier is recommended. Although it is the most expensive, its superior limits, especially the $150k coverage for overseas medical expenses related to the pre-existing condition (via the mandatory add-on), provide the most robust protection for a trip to Europe where medical costs can be high. The higher limits for cancellation, luggage, and travel delay also align best with the customer's desire for comprehensive, top-tier coverage and flexible budget. The Business tier is a strong contender, but the First tier's higher pre-existing condition medical limit makes it the most suitable choice given the specific health requirement and destination. Both the 'Pre-existing medical conditions' and 'Pet care' covers must be purchased as optional add-ons to fully meet the requirements.
