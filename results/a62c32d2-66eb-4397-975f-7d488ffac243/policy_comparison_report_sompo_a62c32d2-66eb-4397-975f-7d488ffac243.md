**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a 3-week trip to Europe:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable. It offers the lowest limits for medical ($150k), cancellation ($5k), and luggage ($3k). Crucially, it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions under the Emergency Medical Evacuation benefit and generally excludes them, failing a key requirement. It also does not explicitly cover hiking under its amateur sports definition and completely lacks the required Pet Accommodation coverage.
*   **Deluxe:** Offers moderate limits (Medical $300k, Cancellation $6k, Luggage $5k). It covers hiking ("trekking up to 3,500m"). It provides limited cover ($100k) for pre-existing conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation, which partially addresses the need but introduces ambiguity and a potentially insufficient limit. Like Vital, it completely lacks the required Pet Accommodation coverage.
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for travel to Japan and is therefore irrelevant for the customer's trip to Europe.
*   **Elite:** Provides the highest limits across all key areas (Medical $1M, Cancellation $15k, Luggage $8k, Travel Delay $2k), aligning well with the customer's request for "Comprehensive Coverage" and "Top-tier service" and their "Flexible budget". It explicitly covers hiking ("trekking up to 3,500m"). It offers the highest available limit ($150k) for pre-existing conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation among the tiers, although this is still a limitation and doesn't fully remove ambiguity regarding general medical expenses for the condition. However, like Vital and Deluxe, the Elite tier documentation provided **does not mention any coverage for Pet Accommodation costs**, failing this critical requirement ("absolutely must be included").

**Conclusion:** None of the available SOMPO tiers perfectly meet all requirements due to the universal lack of explicit Pet Accommodation coverage in the provided policy details. However, considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the Elite tier is the *most suitable* option. It provides the highest overall benefit limits, best matching the customer's desire for comprehensive, top-tier coverage and addressing their concern about significant delays with the highest delay benefit. It covers hiking and offers the best (though still limited) provision for pre-existing condition evacuation compared to other relevant tiers. The significant gap remains the Pet Accommodation cover, which is absent across all tiers examined.

Therefore, the Elite tier is recommended as the best available fit, acknowledging the explicit lack of Pet Accommodation coverage which must be communicated to the customer.
