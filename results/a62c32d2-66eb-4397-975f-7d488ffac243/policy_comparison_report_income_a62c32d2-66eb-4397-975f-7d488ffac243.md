**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All tiers cover core requirements like Medical Expenses, Trip Cancellation, Travel Delay, Lost Luggage, and Hiking to varying degrees. Classic offers the lowest limits (e.g., $5k Cancellation, $250k Medical under 70). Deluxe provides mid-range limits (e.g., $10k Cancellation, $500k Medical under 70). Preferred offers the highest limits (e.g., $15k Cancellation, $1M Medical under 70, $8k Luggage).

Crucially, **none** of the provided standard INCOME tiers (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred) explicitly mention coverage for "Pet Accommodation Costs" due to travel delays, which was a critical requirement for the customer. Furthermore, all standard tiers explicitly state they **do not cover pre-existing medical conditions** (like the customer's High Blood Pressure) unless a specific rider is purchased (which is not detailed here). The policy will cover *unrelated* medical emergencies, but not issues arising from the high blood pressure itself.

Despite these significant gaps common across all tiers, the customer requested "comprehensive coverage", indicated a "flexible budget", expects "top-tier service", and is a "loyal customer". These factors suggest a preference for the highest level of protection available among the standard options. The Preferred tier provides the highest benefit limits for Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), and Lost/Damaged Luggage ($8k), best aligning with the desire for comprehensive, top-tier coverage. Hiking is covered under "Adventurous Activities" in all tiers, including Preferred. Travel Delay benefits are similar across tiers but capped highest in Preferred ($2000).

Therefore, considering the No Mix-and-Match rule and the customer's stated preferences for comprehensive cover and top-tier service within a flexible budget, the **Preferred** tier is recommended as the most suitable option *among the standard tiers provided*, despite its inability to meet the Pet Accommodation and Pre-existing Condition requirements as specified. The significant gaps must be communicated clearly to the customer.
