## Final Recommendation
Based on a detailed analysis of your requirements against available policies, the recommended policy is:

**GELS - Platinum**

### Justification
The final recommendation is **gels Platinum**. This decision is based on a comparative analysis against the other finalists, income Preferred and fwd First, focusing on the critical customer requirements.

1.  **Critical Requirement Fulfillment:** Both gels Platinum and fwd First can meet the core requirements, including the essential Pre-existing Condition (High Blood Pressure) and Pet Accommodation coverage, albeit through optional add-ons. However, income Preferred fails significantly as its standard plan explicitly excludes pre-existing conditions (Report: Page 5) and lacks any mention of Pet Accommodation coverage (Report: Not Met assessment), making it unsuitable despite its high general limits.

2.  **Pre-existing Condition Coverage:** This is a crucial factor. While both gels and fwd require an add-on, gels Platinum offers a higher sub-limit for overseas medical expenses and emergency evacuation/repatriation related to the pre-existing condition ($200,000 - Report: Page 5, Section 38) compared to fwd First ($150,000 - Report: Page 9, Optional Covers & Page 24). For a 3-week trip to Europe where medical costs can be high, this higher sub-limit provides more robust protection and better aligns with the 'comprehensive coverage' requirement. Both policies impose a 50% co-payment for trip cancellation/disruption due to pre-existing conditions (gels: Page 5, Section 38f; fwd: Page 9, Optional Covers & Page 22).

3.  **Pet Care Coverage:** gels Platinum includes Pet Care coverage within the tier itself, offering a substantial limit of $800 ($100 per day - Report: Page 5, Section 30). In contrast, fwd First requires a *separate* optional add-on for Pet Care, and the coverage limit is significantly lower at $150 ($50 per 6 hours delay - Report: Page 9, Optional Covers & Page 28). gels provides superior value and convenience for this requirement.

4.  **Travel Delay:** The customer expressed concern about 'significant delays' and desired a 'reasonable' trigger. gels Platinum excels here with a 4-hour trigger and a high limit of $2,000 ($100 per 4 hours - Report: Page 4, Section 21). fwd First has a less favourable 6-hour trigger and a lower limit of $1,000 ($100 per 6 hours - Report: Page 12). income Preferred also has a 6-hour trigger.

5.  **Luggage Protection:** gels Platinum offers a slightly higher limit ($8,000 - Report: Page 4, Section 22) than fwd First ($7,500 - Report: Page 14). Furthermore, the fwd report explicitly states that payment is based on depreciation (Report: Page 15), which might not fully meet the customer's expectation of 'proper reimbursement'. The gels report does not specify depreciation, potentially offering better terms.

6.  **Overall Value and Alignment:** Although gels Platinum requires an add-on for the pre-existing condition (like fwd) and has a $100 co-pay for outpatient medical treatment related to it (Report: Page 5, Section 38a), its superior pre-existing condition sub-limits, significantly better included Pet Care, more favourable Travel Delay terms, and potentially better luggage reimbursement basis make it the strongest overall choice. It requires only one add-on purchase compared to two for fwd, simplifying the process. gels Platinum best balances comprehensive coverage, high limits, and specific benefit features aligned with the customer's stated needs and flexible budget.
