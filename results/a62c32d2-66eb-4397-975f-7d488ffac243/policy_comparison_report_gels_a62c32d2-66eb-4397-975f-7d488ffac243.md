**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** Fails to meet several core requirements. It explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions (like High Blood Pressure), does not cover adventurous activities (like Hiking), and lacks Pet Care coverage. Its financial limits for medical, cancellation, and luggage are also significantly lower.
*   **Gold:** Offers a significant step up, covering adventurous activities and Pet Care. Crucially, it allows for an optional add-on to cover pre-existing conditions (essential for the customer's High Blood Pressure). However, its limits ($500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage, $500 Pet Care) are lower than Platinum, and the travel delay trigger is 6 hours.
*   **Platinum:** Provides the highest limits ($1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage, $800 Pet Care) and, like Gold, offers the essential optional add-on for pre-existing conditions. It covers adventurous activities (Hiking) and Pet Care. Critically, it features a shorter travel delay trigger (4 hours vs. 6 hours for Gold), better aligning with the customer's concern about "significant delays" and desire for a "reasonable" trigger.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. While Gold with the add-on meets the basic requirements, the Platinum tier with the add-on provides a superior level of coverage that better aligns with the customer's request for "comprehensive coverage", "top-tier service", higher limits, specific coverage for hiking and pet care, and addresses the concern about "significant delays" more effectively with its 4-hour trigger. The customer's "flexible budget" also supports selecting the tier with the most robust protection. Therefore, Platinum is the single most suitable tier.
