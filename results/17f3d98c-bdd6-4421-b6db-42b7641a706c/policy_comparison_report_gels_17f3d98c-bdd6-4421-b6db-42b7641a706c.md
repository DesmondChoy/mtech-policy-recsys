**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers: The Basic tier is unsuitable as it completely lacks the specific golf-related coverages (equipment, green fees, hole-in-one, buggy liability) that are crucial requirements for this customer. The Gold tier covers all the core requirements (medical, cancellation, luggage, delays) and includes the specific 'Golfer's cover' addressing equipment ($500 limit), unused green fees ($250), and hole-in-one ($250). It also provides Personal Liability and Rental Vehicle Excess cover relevant to buggy damage. The Platinum tier also covers all requirements but offers significantly higher limits across most categories, including Medical ($1M vs $500k), Trip Cancellation ($15k vs $10k), Baggage Loss ($8k vs $5k), and notably, Golf Equipment ($1000 vs $500).

Given the customer's explicit focus on golf ("Lots of golf", "worried about my clubs"), the higher $1000 limit for golf equipment under the Platinum tier makes it demonstrably more suitable than the Gold tier's $500 limit, which might be insufficient for valuable clubs. While Platinum is the most expensive tier and may exceed the customer's initial budget preference of $200-$300, it provides the most robust protection aligned with their primary activity and concerns. The No Mix-and-Match rule prevents taking the golf cover from Platinum and combining it with a cheaper base plan. Therefore, Platinum is recommended as the single best fit, offering comprehensive coverage with limits that better address the customer's specific golfing needs compared to the Gold tier. The tie-breaking rule is not applied as Platinum is deemed more suitable than Gold due to the enhanced golf equipment coverage.
