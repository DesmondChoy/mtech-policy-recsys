**Recommended Tier:** : Classic

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All three tiers provide coverage for the core requirements, including overseas medical expenses, trip cancellation, lost/damaged/delayed luggage, and travel delays, with increasing benefit limits from Classic to Preferred. All tiers also cover participation in leisure activities like golf and sightseeing under their general terms or specific 'Adventurous Activities' sections.

However, a key differentiator is the customer's specific golf-related requirements. Based *strictly* on the provided JSON policy details for INCOME, none of the tiers (Classic, Deluxe, or Preferred) explicitly mention coverage for:
*   Reimbursement for unused green fees
*   Liability for golf buggy damage (Personal Liability usually excludes property in care/control, and Rental Vehicle Excess typically applies to cars)
*   Hole-in-one benefits

While golf equipment is covered under the 'Loss or damage of baggage and personal belongings' section in all tiers, the sub-limit per item/set/pair is $500 across Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred, which might be insufficient for high-value clubs.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. Since none of the tiers fully meet the specific golf requirements based on the provided data, and the potentially crucial per-item limit for golf equipment is the same across all tiers, the decision leans towards the most budget-conscious option that still covers the core needs. The Classic tier provides essential coverage for medical, cancellation, luggage, and delays, includes the standard $500 per item limit for golf equipment under baggage, and is the most likely to align with the customer's stated budget of $200-$300 for two travellers. Choosing Deluxe or Preferred would increase costs without adding the specifically requested (and missing) golf coverages.

Therefore, the Classic tier is recommended as the most relatively suitable option, balancing core coverage needs with the budget constraint, while acknowledging the significant coverage gaps for the specific golf benefits requested based on the provided policy information.
