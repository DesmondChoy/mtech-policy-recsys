**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers cover core requirements like Medical Expenses, Trip Cancellation, Luggage, and Travel Delays, but with varying limits (Premium lowest, First highest). A key customer requirement is specific golf coverage. Critically, none of the FWD tiers (Premium, Business, or First) provide coverage for unused green fees, liability for golf buggy damage, or hole-in-one benefits. Coverage for golf equipment loss/damage is only available via an *optional* add-on ("Sports equipment protector") across all tiers, which has a standard limit ($2,000) and importantly excludes damage occurring while the equipment is in use.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule and the fact that key golf-specific benefits are unavailable across all FWD tiers, the choice focuses on balancing the core coverage levels against the price ranking. The Premium tier offers the lowest limits ($200k Medical, $7.5k Cancellation), which might be insufficient. The First tier offers the highest limits ($1M Medical, $15k Cancellation) but is the most expensive.

The **Business** tier is recommended because it offers a strong balance. It provides significantly higher core coverage limits than Premium (e.g., $500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $5k Baggage) and includes Car Rental Excess cover (though this doesn't apply to golf buggies). While it requires the same optional add-on for limited golf equipment coverage as the other tiers, its robust core protection and mid-range price position (cheaper than First according to the ranking) make it the most suitable option, acknowledging the significant gaps in meeting the customer's specific golf-related requests (green fees, buggy liability, hole-in-one).
