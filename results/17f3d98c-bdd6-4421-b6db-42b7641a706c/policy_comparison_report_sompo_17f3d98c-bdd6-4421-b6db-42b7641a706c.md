**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

The customer requires comprehensive travel insurance for a 10-day golf trip to Australia for two travellers (41-55), including standard coverage (medical, cancellation, luggage, delay) and specific golf-related benefits (equipment, unused green fees, buggy liability, hole-in-one).

Comparing the relevant SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, Elite - excluding the irrelevant GO Japan! tier):
*   **Vital:** Offers basic coverage but completely lacks any specific golf benefits (unused green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one) and has lower limits for core coverage ($150k medical, $5k cancellation, $3k baggage). It does not meet the customer's key requirements.
*   **Deluxe:** Provides better core coverage limits than Vital ($300k medical, $6k cancellation, $5k baggage). It includes a 'Golf Cover' section, but this *only* covers loss/damage to golf equipment up to $500 and explicitly states "N.A." (Not Applicable) for hole-in-one, unused green fees, and buggy damage. Therefore, it fails to meet most of the customer's specific golf needs.
*   **Elite:** Offers the highest limits for core coverage ($1M medical, $15k cancellation, $8k baggage). Crucially, its 'Golf Cover' section (Section 36) explicitly includes benefits for *all* the customer's requested golf items: loss/damage to equipment ($1000), hole-in-one ($500), unused green fees ($250), and damage to buggy ($500).

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must choose one complete tier), the Elite tier is the only option from SOMPO that holistically addresses all the specified requirements, particularly the critical golf-related coverages. While potentially the most expensive, it provides the necessary comprehensive protection requested. The Tie-Breaking Rule was not needed as Elite was the only tier meeting all key requirements.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides comprehensive coverage for all specific golf requirements (equipment, green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one) via the dedicated Golf Cover section.
    *   Offers the highest limits among the tiers for core benefits like Overseas Medical Expenses ($1M pp), Trip Cancellation ($15k pp), and Baggage Loss/Damage ($8k pp).
    *   Includes Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for travellers under 70.
    *   Covers amateur sports participation.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Golf Equipment Coverage limit ($1000) might be insufficient for very high-value clubs/equipment.
    *   Hole-in-one benefit ($500) is typically conditional (e.g., during a competition, as per source details), which might not cover casual play achievements.
    *   Likely the most expensive tier, potentially exceeding the customer's initial budget range (though budget flexibility was implied).
