**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the customer's 10-day trip to Japan: All tiers cover the core requirements of medical treatment, trip cancellation, lost/damaged luggage, and travel delays, but with significantly different coverage limits. A key requirement is coverage for medical expenses related to a pre-existing condition (asthma), which necessitates purchasing the 'Pre-existing medical conditions' optional add-on, available across all tiers but with varying sub-limits. Japan is known for high medical costs, and the customer expressed specific concern about this.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits ($200k base medical, $50k pre-existing medical add-on limit, $7.5k cancellation, $3k luggage). These limits, especially for pre-existing conditions, might be insufficient for potential complications in Japan.
*   **Business:** Provides a significant step up ($500k base medical, $100k pre-existing medical add-on limit, $10k cancellation, $5k luggage). This offers a good balance but may still leave exposure given the high-cost destination and pre-existing condition.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits ($1M base medical, $150k pre-existing medical add-on limit, $15k cancellation, $7.5k luggage). This tier provides the most comprehensive financial protection, particularly addressing the customer's primary concern about medical expenses and the specific need for pre-existing condition coverage in Japan.

The customer's specific request for a *double payout* for accidental death on public transport is not explicitly met by the standard Personal Accident benefit description in *any* of the FWD tiers based on the provided data. All tiers cover accidental death up to their respective limits ($200k Premium, $300k Business, $400k First) regardless of whether it occurs on public transport, but without the specified doubling feature.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. While First is the most expensive, its superior limits for medical expenses (both base and pre-existing conditions) and trip cancellation align best with the customer's stated concerns and the high-cost nature of the destination (Japan). The peace of mind offered by these higher limits makes it the most suitable choice despite the unmet double PA payout request.

Therefore, the **First** tier is recommended as it provides the highest level of coverage for the customer's most critical requirements (medical expenses, pre-existing condition coverage in Japan, trip cancellation), offering the best protection against their primary concerns, even though the specific double PA payout feature is not available.

    *   **Conditional Limits:** N/A
    *   **Source Specific Details:** Standard travel insurance policies typically cover leisure activities like hiking unless they are considered extreme or hazardous (e.g., mountaineering requiring ropes, professional sports). The FWD policy wording (General Exclusions, Page 31-32) excludes claims arising from engaging in sports or activities known to be hazardous, or taking part in speed/duration contests or professional sports. Standard hiking is unlikely to fall under these exclusions.
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met: Assuming the hiking is non-extreme leisure hiking, it should be covered under the general scope of the policy, particularly the medical and personal accident benefits if an incident occurs.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: First

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Highest available limits for key concerns: Medical Expenses Overseas ($1M base), Trip Cancellation ($15k), and Personal Accident ($400k).
    *   Highest available limit ($150k) for the crucial 'Pre-existing medical conditions' optional add-on, essential for the customer's asthma coverage in Japan.
    *   Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation (base coverage).
    *   High limits for Luggage ($7.5k) and Travel Delay ($1k overseas).
    *   Includes Car Rental Excess cover ($1k) in the base plan.

    *   Pre-existing Conditions Coverage: Requires purchase of an optional add-on, and claims for trip cancellation/postponement/cut short/disruption due to the condition are subject to a 50% co-payment.
    *   Cost: This is the most expensive tier among the options.
