**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a 10-day trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable primarily because it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under the Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation benefit (Section 4, N.A.), which is critical given the customer's asthma. It also has the lowest coverage limits and does not explicitly cover hiking under its amateur sports definition.
*   **Deluxe:** Offers basic coverage for core requirements, includes hiking ("trekking up to 3,500m"), and provides a $100,000 limit for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions. However, its overall limits ($300k Medical, $6k Cancellation) are moderate. It does not meet the request for a double payout on accidental death via public transport.
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for Japan, offering higher medical limits ($500k) than Deluxe and the convenience of cashless medical services in Japan. It matches Deluxe on hiking coverage and the $100,000 pre-existing condition evacuation limit. Like Deluxe, it does not offer the requested double payout benefit. It's a strong contender due to the Japan-specific features.
*   **Elite:** Provides the highest coverage limits across all key areas ($1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage, $2k Delay). Crucially, it offers the highest limit for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions ($150,000), addressing the customer's asthma concern more robustly. It covers hiking up to 3,500m. While it also does not meet the specific request for a double payout on accidental death via public transport, it offers the highest base Personal Accident cover ($500k).

**Conclusion:** Although the specific "double payout" requirement cannot be met by any SOMPO tier based on the provided data, the Elite tier is recommended. It offers the most comprehensive protection with the highest limits, particularly for medical expenses (a stated "big worry") and emergency evacuation considering the pre-existing asthma condition ($150k limit vs $100k in Deluxe/GO Japan!). While GO Japan! offers cashless service, Elite's significantly higher financial safety net across multiple categories provides a better overall fit for the customer's needs and concerns, adhering to the No Mix-and-Match rule where the entire tier's benefits must be considered.
