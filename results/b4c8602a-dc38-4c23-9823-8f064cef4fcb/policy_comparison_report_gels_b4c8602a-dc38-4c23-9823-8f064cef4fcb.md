**Recommended Tier:** : Gold (Requires purchase of Pre-existing Conditions Add-on)

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers against the customer's requirements for a 10-day trip to Japan:

*   **Basic Tier:** This tier is unsuitable. It explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions (like the customer's asthma) under medical and evacuation benefits (Page 3, Section 3&4 Note; Page 5, Section 38). Furthermore, it does not offer the requested "Public transport double indemnity" (Page 3, Section 2), a specific requirement. It also excludes "Adventurous leisure activities" (Page 5, Section 37), which could potentially impact the coverage for hiking depending on the policy definition, although the primary reasons for unsuitability are the lack of pre-existing condition cover and double indemnity.
*   **Gold Tier:** This tier covers all the core requirements: medical expenses (SGD 500k), trip cancellation (SGD 10k), lost luggage (SGD 5k), and travel delays (SGD 1.5k overseas). Crucially, it offers the required "Public transport double indemnity" (SGD 500k) (Page 3, Item 2). It also covers "Adventurous leisure activities" like hiking (Page 5, Item 37). Most importantly, it allows the purchase of an optional "Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit" (Page 5, Section 38) which can cover the customer's asthma for medical expenses, evacuation, cancellation, etc., subject to specific limits and co-payments.
*   **Platinum Tier:** This tier also meets all requirements, offering higher limits than Gold (e.g., SGD 1M medical, SGD 15k cancellation, SGD 1M double indemnity) and slightly better travel delay triggers (4 hours vs 6 hours). It also covers hiking and offers the same optional "Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit".

**Selection:** Both the Gold and Platinum tiers (with the necessary Pre-existing Conditions Add-on) meet all the customer's stated requirements, including the specific requests for asthma coverage and public transport double indemnity. The Basic tier fails on multiple critical points. Since both Gold and Platinum (with the add-on) are suitable options, the **Tie-Breaking Rule** is applied based on the price ranking (Basic < Gold < Platinum). Therefore, the Gold tier, being the cheaper of the two suitable options, is recommended.

**Note:** The suitability of the Gold tier is **contingent upon the purchase of the optional Pre-existing Conditions Add-on benefit** to cover the customer's asthma. Without this add-on, the Gold tier would not fully meet the requirements.
