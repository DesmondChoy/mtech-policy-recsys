**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a trip to Thailand:

1.  **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable. It explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under the Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation section (Section 4, N.A.), which is critical given the customer's partner has asthma. Furthermore, it does not cover Scuba Diving, as Leisure Underwater Activities cover is Not Applicable (Section 28) and specific Amateur Sports cover is not mentioned as included.
2.  **GO Japan!:** This tier is designed specifically for travel to Japan and is therefore unsuitable for the customer's trip to Thailand.
3.  **Deluxe:** This tier meets several key requirements. It offers $300k for Overseas Medical Expenses, Unlimited Evacuation (with a $100k sub-limit for pre-existing conditions like asthma), specific cover for Leisure Underwater Activities (including Scuba Diving, Section 28, $250k aggregate limit), $6k Trip Cancellation, and $5k Luggage cover. However, it does not mention the specific 'double payout on public transport' for Accidental Death.
4.  **Elite:** This tier provides significantly higher coverage limits compared to Deluxe, aligning better with the customer's request for "comprehensive" coverage and a "flexible budget". It offers $1M Overseas Medical Expenses, Unlimited Evacuation (with a higher $150k sub-limit for pre-existing conditions), a higher aggregate limit for Leisure Underwater Activities ($350k), $15k Trip Cancellation, and $8k Luggage cover. Like Deluxe, it covers the core needs but also does not explicitly mention the 'double payout on public transport' feature for Accidental Death.

**Conclusion:** Both Deluxe and Elite cover the essential requirements, including the critical pre-existing condition evacuation and scuba diving. However, given the customer's emphasis on comprehensive coverage and flexible budget, the Elite tier is the superior choice due to its substantially higher limits across medical, evacuation (pre-existing), cancellation, luggage, and activities cover. While neither tier meets the specific 'double payout on public transport' requirement, Elite provides the most robust overall protection. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose one tier, and Elite offers the best package despite the single unmet detail.
