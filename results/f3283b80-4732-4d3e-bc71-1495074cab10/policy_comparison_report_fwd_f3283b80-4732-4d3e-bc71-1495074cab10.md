**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers offer core travel insurance benefits like medical, cancellation, and baggage cover. However, they differ significantly in coverage limits and how they address the customer's specific needs, particularly the pre-existing condition (Asthma) and the desire for "comprehensive" coverage with a flexible budget.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Overseas Medical, $7.5k Cancellation, $3k Baggage). The optional pre-existing condition add-on provides only $50k for overseas medical expenses related to Asthma. This might not meet the customer's need for comprehensive cover, especially given their concern about hospital bills for Asthma.
*   **Business:** Provides higher limits than Premium (e.g., $500k Overseas Medical, $10k Cancellation, $5k Baggage). The pre-existing add-on offers $100k for overseas medical. This is a significant improvement over Premium.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits across the board (e.g., $1M Overseas Medical, $15k Cancellation, $7.5k Baggage). Crucially, the optional pre-existing condition add-on provides $150k for overseas medical expenses related to Asthma and $15k for trip cancellation (50% co-pay applies).

The customer requires coverage for Asthma, comprehensive medical protection (including hospital stays), scuba diving, trip cancellation, luggage, and travel delay. They have a flexible budget and prioritize good coverage. All tiers require the purchase of an *optional add-on* for the pre-existing Asthma condition. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must select the tier that best covers *all* requirements, including the need for robust medical and pre-existing condition coverage.

Therefore, the **First** tier is recommended. Although it is the most expensive, it provides substantially higher limits for core benefits like medical expenses (both base and pre-existing), trip cancellation, and travel delay compared to Premium and Business. This best aligns with the customer's desire for comprehensive coverage and flexible budget, offering greater peace of mind regarding potential medical emergencies related to Asthma or other unforeseen events. The requirement for double accidental death payout on public transport is not met by any FWD tier. Leisure scuba diving medical/accident cover is assumed included in the base policy for all tiers.
