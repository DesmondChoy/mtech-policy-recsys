**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** Fails to meet several critical requirements. It explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions like Asthma, does not cover adventurous activities like Scuba Diving, and lacks the requested Public Transport Double Indemnity benefit.
*   **Gold:** Meets all core requirements when combined with the optional Pre-existing Conditions Add-on Benefit. It covers emergency medical expenses (including Asthma via the add-on), trip cancellation (including Asthma via the add-on), lost/damaged luggage, travel delay, accidental death with public transport double indemnity, and adventurous activities like Scuba Diving.
*   **Platinum:** Also meets all core requirements when combined with the optional Pre-existing Conditions Add-on Benefit, offering higher coverage limits and slightly better triggers (e.g., travel delay payout starts at 4 hours vs. 6 hours for Gold).

Both the Gold and Platinum tiers (with the necessary add-on) provide the comprehensive coverage requested, including the specific needs for Asthma, Scuba Diving, and double indemnity. The customer indicated a flexible budget prioritizing good coverage but did not explicitly demand the absolute maximum limits available. Since both Gold (with add-on) and Platinum (with add-on) fulfill all stated requirements, they are considered suitable options. Applying the Tie-Breaking Rule, which mandates selecting the cheapest among equally suitable tiers, the Gold tier is recommended as it appears earlier in the price ranking (Basic < Gold < Platinum). The purchase of the Pre-existing Conditions Add-on Benefit is essential for this recommendation to be valid for the customer's Asthma condition.
