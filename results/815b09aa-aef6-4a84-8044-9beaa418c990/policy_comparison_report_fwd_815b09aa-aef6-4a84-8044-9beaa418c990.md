**Recommended Tier:** Business

**Justification:**

The customer requires comprehensive coverage for a 10-day trip to Japan for two adults, including emergency medical, trip cancellation, lost luggage, travel delays, and specific coverage for skiing activities, with a budget preference of $200-$300.

Comparing the three FWD tiers (Premium, Business, First):

1.  **Premium:** While being the cheapest and most likely to fit the budget, its coverage limits are relatively low, especially the S$200,000 limit for Overseas Medical Expenses. This might be insufficient given the potential costs of medical care in Japan and the inherent risks associated with skiing. The Travel Delay limit (S$300) is also quite low.
2.  **First:** Offers the highest limits (S$1M Medical, S$15k Cancellation) but is the most expensive tier and likely exceeds the customer's preferred budget significantly.
3.  **Business:** Provides a strong balance between coverage levels and cost. It offers significantly higher limits than Premium across key areas:
    *   Overseas Medical Expenses: S$500,000 (vs. S$200k in Premium) - More appropriate for Japan and skiing.
    *   Trip Cancellation: S$10,000 (vs. S$7.5k in Premium).
    *   Lost/Damaged Luggage: S$5,000 (vs. S$3k in Premium).
    *   Travel Delay: S$500 (vs. S$300 in Premium).
    *   It also includes Car Rental Excess cover, which wasn't requested but adds value.

While the Business tier might be at the higher end or slightly above the customer's $200-$300 budget preference (noted as "if possible"), the substantially increased protection, particularly the medical coverage crucial for skiing in Japan, makes it the holistically most suitable option. It addresses all core requirements with more robust limits than Premium, without the likely prohibitive cost of the First tier. Therefore, the Business tier is recommended as the best overall fit.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Business

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides robust coverage across all requested areas (Medical, Cancellation, Luggage, Delay, Skiing Activity - assumed).
    *   Offers a strong Overseas Medical Expense limit (S$500,000), suitable for potential costs in Japan and the risks associated with skiing.
    *   Includes Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation.
    *   Provides higher limits for Trip Cancellation, Luggage, and Travel Delay compared to the Premium tier.
    *   Includes Car Rental Excess cover as a standard benefit.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   The Travel Delay benefit provides a fixed cash payout per 6 hours, not direct reimbursement for accommodation/meals as specified in the detailed request (though the cash can be used for this purpose). Trip Disruption covers accommodation/meals but only for specific, limited causes.
    *   Explicit confirmation that leisure skiing *activity* (medical/liability) is covered under the standard policy terms is missing from the provided JSON data (coverage is assumed based on typical policy structures and lack of exclusion).
    *   The price might be at the upper end or slightly exceed the customer's preferred budget range of $200-$300.
