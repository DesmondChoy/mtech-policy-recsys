**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers provide core coverage for medical expenses, luggage, travel delay, and standard trip cancellation reasons. Hiking, as a leisure activity, is typically covered under the general scope of activities in all tiers, provided it's not professional or exceptionally hazardous (subject to policy definitions and exclusions).

The key differentiator is the customer's specific requirement for cancellation coverage due to a sister's wedding. This personal reason is *not* covered under the standard 'Trip cancellation and loss of deposit' benefit in *any* tier. However, FWD offers an optional 'Cancel for any reason' (CFAR) add-on, available for purchase with any tier (within 7 days of initial trip deposit). This add-on provides 50% reimbursement for non-refundable costs up to a certain limit if the trip is cancelled for reasons not covered by the base policy.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest base limits (e.g., $200k Medical Overseas, $7.5k Base Cancellation, $3k Luggage) and the lowest CFAR reimbursement limit ($1k). This might not meet the customer's need for "comprehensive" coverage.
*   **Business:** Provides significantly higher base limits than Premium (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Base Cancellation, $5k Luggage) and a higher CFAR reimbursement limit ($3k). This offers a good balance of comprehensive base coverage and better potential reimbursement for the specific wedding cancellation scenario.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Base Cancellation, $7.5k Luggage) and the highest CFAR reimbursement limit ($6k). While offering the most coverage, it is the most expensive tier and may exceed the customer's budget preference, especially with the added cost of the CFAR option.

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must choose one tier), the Business tier provides a strong middle ground. It offers substantially better base coverage than Premium, aligning better with the "comprehensive" requirement, and provides a more meaningful CFAR reimbursement limit ($3k) than Premium for the specific wedding cancellation concern, without potentially reaching the higher cost of the First tier.

Therefore, the **Business** tier is recommended as it offers a balanced level of comprehensive coverage across all requirements and provides access to the necessary (optional) 'Cancel for any reason' cover with a reasonable reimbursement limit ($3k), likely offering the best value proposition relative to the customer's needs and budget preference compared to Premium and First.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Base cancellation covers standard specified reasons up to $10,000. Cancellation for a sister's wedding is *not* a standard covered reason. This specific reason can only be covered (at 50% reimbursement up to $3,000) if the optional 'Cancel for any reason' add-on is purchased separately and within 7 days of the initial trip deposit.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Business

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides comprehensive coverage levels for core requirements like Medical Expenses Overseas ($500k), Luggage ($5k), and Travel Delay ($500 overseas).
    *   Includes Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation.
    *   Covers leisure hiking under general activity scope (subject to policy terms).
    *   Offers access to the 'Cancel for any reason' optional add-on, which is necessary to potentially cover the specific request for cancellation due to a sister's wedding, with a reasonable reimbursement limit ($3k).
    *   Provides a good balance between coverage levels and likely cost compared to Premium and First tiers.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip Cancellation Coverage: Cancellation due to the sister's wedding is explicitly *not* covered under the base policy. It requires purchasing the optional 'Cancel for any reason' add-on (at extra cost, within 7 days of deposit), which only provides 50% reimbursement up to a $3,000 limit. This requirement is therefore only partially met and conditional on purchasing the add-on.
