**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a 2-week trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it lacks explicit coverage for amateur sports like hiking (a key requirement) and has the lowest overall limits for medical ($150k), luggage ($3k), and cancellation ($5k).
*   **Deluxe:** This tier meets the core requirements, including explicit hiking coverage (trekking up to 3500m) and provides decent limits ($300k medical, $5k luggage, $6k cancellation, $1k delay).
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier also explicitly covers hiking up to 3500m. It offers higher overseas medical coverage ($500k) than Deluxe and includes valuable Japan-specific benefits like a cashless medical network (740 clinics/hospitals) and a dedicated assistance hotline (EAJ). Luggage ($5k), cancellation ($6k), and travel delay ($1k) limits are the same as Deluxe.
*   **Elite:** This tier provides the highest limits across all categories ($1M medical, $8k luggage, $15k cancellation, $2k delay) and covers hiking. However, it lacks the Japan-specific medical network offered by the GO Japan! tier and is the most expensive option.

**Reasoning for Selection:**
The customer requires coverage for general medical, hiking, luggage, travel delay, and trip cancellation for a trip to Japan. All tiers except Vital cover hiking up to 3500m. The critical requirement for trip cancellation due to a sister's wedding is unlikely to be covered under any standard policy's definition of "Insured Events," as this typically relates to unforeseen emergencies (like illness/death) rather than personal scheduling choices. Therefore, this specific cancellation reason is likely excluded across all tiers.

Considering the remaining requirements and the destination:
*   GO Japan! offers significantly higher medical coverage ($500k) than Deluxe ($300k).
*   Crucially, GO Japan! provides Japan-specific medical assistance features (cashless network, dedicated hotline), which directly addresses potential medical needs in the destination country, offering greater convenience and peace of mind compared to Deluxe or Elite.
*   While Elite offers higher limits, the limits provided by GO Japan! ($500k medical, $6k cancellation, $5k luggage) are substantial and generally sufficient for a 2-week trip for travellers in the specified age group with no pre-existing conditions.
*   Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, GO Japan! presents the most tailored and suitable package for this specific trip to Japan, balancing comprehensive coverage (including hiking) with destination-specific benefits. It offers a better fit than Deluxe due to higher medical limits and Japan features, and arguably a more practical fit than Elite by providing relevant destination support without potentially excessive limits (and associated higher cost).

Therefore, the **GO Japan!** tier is recommended as the single most suitable option, offering robust coverage for the core requirements, explicit hiking cover, and valuable Japan-specific medical support features.
