**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements reveals significant differences. The Vital tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation and does not include the required Amateur Sports Cover for hiking.

Both the Deluxe and GO Japan! tiers offer coverage for hiking (trekking up to 3,500m) and provide Emergency Medical Evacuation cover for pre-existing conditions up to SGD 100,000. GO Japan! adds the benefit of cashless medical services in Japan. However, their limits for core coverages like Medical Expenses Overseas (SGD 300k for Deluxe, SGD 500k for GO Japan!) and Trip Cancellation (SGD 6k for both) are lower than the Elite tier.

The Elite tier provides the highest coverage limits across all key areas: SGD 1,000,000 for Medical Expenses Overseas, SGD 150,000 for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions, SGD 15,000 for Trip Cancellation, SGD 2,000 maximum for Travel Delay, and SGD 8,000 for Lost/Damaged Luggage. It also includes the necessary Amateur Sports Cover for hiking. These higher limits best align with the customer's explicit need for "comprehensive medical coverage" and address their expressed anxiety about significant financial loss due to medical issues or cancellation ("I just panic thinking about needing medical coverage", "losing all that money... it makes me sick").

Crucially, *none* of the SOMPO tiers explicitly cover the customer's specific request for additional pet accommodation fees due to a delayed return flight. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose the tier that best meets the *majority* of their critical needs.

Therefore, the Elite tier is recommended as it offers the most comprehensive protection and highest financial limits for the core requirements (medical, pre-existing condition evacuation, cancellation, luggage, hiking), providing the greatest peace of mind despite the unavoidable gap in pet accommodation coverage across all available SOMPO tiers.
