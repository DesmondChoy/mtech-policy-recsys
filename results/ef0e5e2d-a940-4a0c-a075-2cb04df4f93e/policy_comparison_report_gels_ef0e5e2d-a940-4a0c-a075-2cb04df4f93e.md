**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers against the customer's requirements:

*   **Basic Tier:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for several critical requirements: pre-existing medical conditions (high blood pressure), additional pet accommodation costs due to travel delay, and adventurous leisure activities like hiking.
*   **Gold Tier:** This tier covers most requirements, including hiking and pet accommodation. It also offers an *optional add-on* for pre-existing medical conditions (high blood pressure) covering medical expenses and trip cancellation/disruption, albeit with specific sub-limits and co-payments. However, the coverage limits for medical ($500k base, $150k pre-existing add-on), trip cancellation ($10k base, $10k pre-existing add-on with 50% co-pay), travel delay ($1500 max, trigger 6 hrs), and pet care ($500 max) are lower than Platinum.
*   **Platinum Tier:** This tier provides the highest level of coverage across all key areas. Like Gold, it covers hiking and pet accommodation, and offers the same *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions but with higher sub-limits ($1M base medical, $200k pre-existing add-on; $15k trip cancellation base, $15k pre-existing add-on with 50% co-pay). It also offers superior travel delay cover ($2000 max, trigger 4 hrs) and higher pet care limits ($800 max).

Given the customer's emphasis on "comprehensive medical coverage" (especially with a pre-existing condition), specific concerns about trip cancellation, travel delays, and pet accommodation costs, the Platinum tier provides the most robust protection. While the Gold tier meets the basic criteria (with the add-on), the Platinum tier's higher limits and better terms (e.g., faster travel delay payout trigger) align more closely with the customer's desire for comprehensive cover and peace of mind. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose the tier that best covers *all* needs collectively. Platinum offers the best holistic fit despite being the most expensive option.

Therefore, the Platinum tier is recommended as it provides the highest available limits and most comprehensive coverage for the customer's specific combination of requirements, particularly the need for robust medical cover (including the pre-existing condition via the necessary add-on), trip cancellation, travel delay, pet care, and hiking.
