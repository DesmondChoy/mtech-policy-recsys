**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All three standard tiers provide core coverage for Trip Cancellation, Travel Delay (cash benefit), Lost/Damaged Luggage, and Hiking. However, a critical requirement is comprehensive medical coverage, specifically noting the pre-existing condition of high blood pressure. **Crucially, none of the standard Classic, Deluxe, or Preferred tiers cover pre-existing medical conditions**, as explicitly stated in their documentation snippets ("Standard plans do not cover pre-existing medical conditions."). This represents a significant gap across all available standard options. Furthermore, the specific request for coverage of additional pet accommodation fees due to a delayed return is **not met by any of the three tiers**.

Given these significant limitations and the No Mix-and-Match rule (meaning the customer cannot add pre-existing condition cover from elsewhere to these plans), the choice must be based on which tier *best* aligns with the remaining requirements and the desire for "comprehensive" coverage in areas where cover *is* provided.

*   **Classic:** Offers the lowest limits ($5k Cancellation, $250k Medical, $3k Luggage).
*   **Deluxe:** Offers mid-range limits ($10k Cancellation, $500k Medical, $5k Luggage).
*   **Preferred:** Offers the highest limits ($15k Cancellation, $1M Medical (non-pre-existing), $8k Luggage, Unlimited Evacuation for under 70s).

Although no tier fully meets the requirements due to the pre-existing condition and pet accommodation exclusions, the **Preferred** tier provides the highest benefit limits across medical (for non-pre-existing conditions), cancellation, travel delay cash benefit, and luggage loss. This aligns best with the customer's stated need for "comprehensive" coverage in the areas that *are* covered by the standard policy. Therefore, despite its shortcomings regarding the specific exclusions, Preferred is recommended as the most suitable option among the three standard tiers provided, offering the highest protection levels for covered events. The significant gap regarding pre-existing conditions must be communicated clearly to the customer.
