**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the customer's trip to Japan: All tiers offer the necessary *types* of coverage (Medical, Cancellation, Delay, Luggage) and allow the purchase of the required optional add-ons for 'Pre-existing medical conditions' and 'Pet care'. However, they differ significantly in their coverage *limits*.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k base medical, $50k pre-ex medical add-on, $7.5k cancellation, $3k luggage). While it includes the necessary add-ons, the limits may not align with the customer's desire for "comprehensive" medical coverage, especially concerning the pre-existing condition.
*   **Business:** Provides mid-range limits (e.g., $500k base medical, $100k pre-ex medical add-on, $10k cancellation, $5k luggage). This is a significant step up from Premium.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits across all key areas (e.g., $1M base medical, $150k pre-ex medical add-on, $15k cancellation, $7.5k luggage). It also provides the highest pre-ex evacuation limit ($150k) compared to Business ($100k).

The customer explicitly requested "comprehensive medical coverage" and expressed concern about potential costs related to a pre-existing condition (high blood pressure). The First tier provides the highest medical limits, both for general overseas expenses and specifically for the pre-existing condition add-on, offering the greatest peace of mind. It also has the highest limits for trip cancellation and luggage loss/damage. The required 'Pet care' add-on provides the same benefit ($150 limit) regardless of the chosen tier.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must choose one complete tier plus add-ons) and the emphasis on comprehensive coverage, the First tier is the most suitable option as it provides the highest level of protection for the customer's key requirements, particularly medical needs related to the pre-existing condition. The higher price point of the First tier is justified by the significantly higher coverage limits compared to Premium and Business.
