**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the customer's 10-day golf trip to Australia: All tiers cover core requirements like medical emergencies, lost/damaged luggage, travel delay, and trip cancellation, but with varying limits. Premium offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k overseas medical), while Business ($500k) and First ($1M) offer significantly higher, more comprehensive core coverage.

The customer has specific golf-related requirements: golf equipment coverage, unused green fees reimbursement, rented golf buggy damage coverage, and a hole-in-one bonus. Critically, analyzing the FWD policy details reveals that:
*   **Golf Equipment:** Coverage requires purchasing the optional "Sports equipment protector" add-on, available for all tiers (Premium, Business, First), offering a $2,000 limit but excluding damage incurred during play.
*   **Unused Green Fees:** No specific benefit exists in any tier to cover this. Standard trip cancellation/curtailment might cover pre-paid costs only if the *entire trip* is cancelled/cut short for a covered reason.
*   **Rented Golf Buggy Damage:** While Business and First include "Car rental excess" coverage ($500 and $1000 respectively; optional for Premium at $300), this benefit typically applies to licensed rental *cars* and is highly unlikely to cover damage to a rented golf buggy. Furthermore, Personal Liability explicitly excludes damage related to motorised vehicles. Therefore, this requirement is not met by any tier.
*   **Hole-in-one Bonus:** No such benefit is offered in any FWD tier.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. Since none of the FWD tiers can fully satisfy all the specific golf requirements (green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one), the decision rests on finding the tier that best covers the core needs and partially covers the equipment, aligning with the request for "comprehensive medical coverage". Both Business ($500k medical) and First ($1M medical) offer substantial core coverage compared to Premium. As neither Business nor First can meet the specific unmet golf needs any better than the other, and both provide a level of core coverage that can be considered "comprehensive", they are deemed *equally suitable* in addressing the customer's requirements to the best extent possible within FWD's offerings.

Applying the Tie-Breaking Rule (cheapest among equally suitable tiers, based on the provided ranking: Premium < Business < First), the **Business** tier is selected. It provides a strong balance of comprehensive core coverage limits without the higher cost of the First tier, acknowledging that certain specific golf benefits requested are unavailable from this insurer. The customer must purchase the "Sports equipment protector" add-on separately with the Business plan to get coverage for their golf clubs.
