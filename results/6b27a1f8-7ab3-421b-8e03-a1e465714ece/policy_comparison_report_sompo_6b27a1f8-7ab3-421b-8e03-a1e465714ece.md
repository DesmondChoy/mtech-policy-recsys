**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a two-week trip to Australia:

1.  **GO Japan!:** This tier is immediately unsuitable as it is specifically designed for travel to Japan, not Australia.
2.  **Vital:** This tier is inadequate. It lacks specific coverage for pre-existing medical conditions (explicitly excluded for Emergency Medical Evacuation and generally excluded per standard terms), which is a key requirement (asthma). Furthermore, it does not appear to offer coverage for adventure sports like white water rafting.
3.  **Deluxe vs. Elite:** Both tiers offer some coverage for pre-existing conditions, specifically for Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation, albeit with sub-limits ($100k for Deluxe, $150k for Elite). Both tiers list covered "Amateur Sports" but **do not include white water rafting**, meaning this activity is likely not covered under either plan based on the provided data. Both tiers cover Trip Cancellation for standard "Insured Events", but the customer's specific reason (sister's rescheduled wedding clashing with travel dates) is highly unlikely to be a covered event under either tier's standard terms.
    *   **Elite** provides significantly higher coverage limits than Deluxe across key areas: Medical Expenses Overseas ($1M vs $300k), Medical Expenses in Singapore ($30k vs $15k), Pre-existing Condition Evacuation ($150k vs $100k), Baggage Loss ($8k vs $5k), Travel Delay ($2k max vs $1k max), and Trip Cancellation ($15k vs $6k).

Given the customer's requirements and the No Mix-and-Match rule (requiring selection of a single complete tier), the **Elite** tier is recommended. While it does not fully meet the requirements for white water rafting coverage and the specific trip cancellation reason, it offers the highest available limits and the best available coverage for the other core requirements, including the limited but present coverage for pre-existing condition evacuation, compared to the other applicable SOMPO tiers (Vital and Deluxe). The higher limits provide greater overall protection for the aspects that *are* covered.

    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person - up to 70 years', 'limit': 'Unlimited', 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - above 70 years', 'limit': 150000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - up to 70 years (Pre-existing Conditions)', 'limit': 150000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - above 70 years (Pre-existing Conditions)', 'limit': 75000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 'No aggregate limit', 'basis': None}]

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met

### Requirement: adventure sports coverage (white water rafting)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Amateur Sports Cover Inclusion

    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'The policy includes coverage under relevant sections (e.g., Personal Accident, Medical Expenses) for participation in amateur sports including tandem air sports (skydiving, hang-gliding, paragliding), snow-skiing, hot-air ballooning, bungee jumping, indoor rock climbing, and trekking up to 3,500m above sea level for all mountains.', 'source_location': 'Page 1 & Page 2, Amateur Sports Cover Highlight'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Not Met: White water rafting is not listed among the covered amateur sports in the provided policy details.

### Requirement: trip cancellation coverage (due to family wedding)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Trip Cancellation or Postponement
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person', 'limit': 15000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 25000, 'basis': None}]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [{'detail_snippet': 'Covers loss of irrecoverable travel deposits or charges paid in advance due to necessary cancellation or postponement of the entire trip arising from Insured Events occurring within 30 days before departure.', 'source_location': 'Page 4, Section 13'}, {'detail_snippet': 'Includes coverage for loss of frequent flyer or similar travel points used to purchase an airline ticket.', 'source_location': 'Page 2, Trip Cancellation or Postponement Highlight'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Provides a high limit for trip cancellation ($15,000) for standard "Insured Events". However, cancellation due to a sister's rescheduled wedding clashing with travel dates is highly unlikely to be considered a standard Insured Event and therefore would likely not be covered. The customer's specific reason is not met.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Highest available coverage limits for Medical Expenses ($1M Overseas), Baggage ($8k), Travel Delay ($2k max), and Trip Cancellation ($15k).
    *   Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for non-pre-existing conditions (under 70s).
    *   Provides the highest available sub-limit ($150k for under 70s) for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions among the SOMPO tiers.
    *   Covers core requirements like medical, delay, and baggage well within its high limits.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Medical Coverage for Pre-existing Conditions: General medical expenses (non-evacuation) related to asthma are likely excluded. Evacuation cover for asthma is capped at $150k.
    *   Adventure Sports Coverage: White water rafting is not listed as a covered activity in the provided policy details and is likely excluded.
    *   Trip Cancellation Coverage: The specific reason requested (cancellation due to sister's rescheduled wedding) is highly unlikely to be covered under the standard "Insured Events" definition.
