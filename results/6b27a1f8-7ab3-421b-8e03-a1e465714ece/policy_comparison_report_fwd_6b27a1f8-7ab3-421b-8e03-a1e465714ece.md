**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers offer base coverage for medical, travel delay, baggage, and trip cancellation, and allow the purchase of optional add-ons for Pre-existing Conditions and Cancel For Any Reason, which are crucial for this customer. However, they differ significantly in coverage limits.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Medical, $7.5k Cancellation, $3k Baggage). The limits under the required Pre-existing Conditions add-on ($50k Medical with 50% co-pay) and the recommended Cancel For Any Reason add-on ($1k limit, 50% reimbursement) are quite low for a trip to Australia and the potential cancellation costs.
*   **Business:** Provides mid-range limits (e.g., $500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $5k Baggage). The Pre-existing Conditions add-on limit ($100k Medical) and Cancel For Any Reason add-on limit ($3k limit, 50% reimbursement) offer better protection than Premium.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $7.5k Baggage). Crucially, it also provides the highest limits under the necessary add-ons: $150k for Pre-existing Medical conditions and a $6k limit (50% reimbursement) for Cancel For Any Reason.

The customer requires coverage for a pre-existing condition (asthma) and is specifically concerned about trip cancellation due to a potential family wedding clash â€“ a reason not typically covered by standard cancellation terms. This necessitates purchasing the "Pre-existing medical conditions" add-on and strongly suggests purchasing the "Cancel for any reason" add-on. Given the destination (Australia, with potentially high medical costs), the pre-existing condition, and the specific cancellation concern, the significantly higher limits offered by the First tier (both in base coverage and within the essential add-ons) provide the most comprehensive and suitable protection, aligning best with the customer's needs for robust coverage despite being the most expensive option. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose the tier that best covers *all* requirements, and First offers the highest level of protection across the board for the identified key needs.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Standard trip cancellation does not cover cancellation due to a rescheduled family wedding. However, if the optional "Cancel for any reason" add-on is purchased (within 7 days of initial trip deposit), the customer can claim 50% of their non-refundable trip costs, up to a limit of $6,000 per person, for this reason. This provides partial coverage for the specific scenario.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: First

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Highest available limits for core coverage (Medical $1M, Cancellation $15k, Baggage $7.5k).
    *   Highest available limits under the essential optional add-ons: $150k for Pre-existing Medical Expenses and $6k limit (50% reimbursement) for Cancel For Any Reason.
    *   Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation (base cover).
    *   Includes Car Rental Excess cover ($1000 limit) as standard.
    *   Covers leisure white water rafting under standard terms (medical/accident).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip Cancellation Coverage (Family Wedding): Standard cancellation does not cover this reason. Requires purchase of the "Cancel for any reason" add-on, which only provides 50% reimbursement up to the $6,000 limit and must be bought within 7 days of the initial trip deposit.
    *   Pre-existing Conditions: Requires purchase of the "Pre-existing medical conditions" add-on for any claims related to asthma. Trip change benefits (cancellation, postponement, cut short, disruption) related to pre-existing conditions under this add-on are subject to a 50% co-payment.
    *   Cost: Likely the most expensive tier, potentially exceeding the customer's initial budget indication (though flexibility was suggested).
