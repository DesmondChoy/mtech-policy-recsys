**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All tiers provide coverage for core requirements like Trip Cancellation, Medical Expenses (excluding pre-existing conditions), Scuba Diving, Luggage issues, and Travel Delay. However, they differ significantly in coverage limits. Classic offers the lowest limits (e.g., $5k Cancellation, $250k Medical), Deluxe offers mid-range limits (e.g., $10k Cancellation, $500k Medical), and Preferred offers the highest limits (e.g., $15k Cancellation, $1M Medical, $8k Luggage).

Crucially, **none** of the standard INCOME tiers provided (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred) cover pre-existing medical conditions like the customer's husband's high blood pressure, as explicitly stated in the policy documents (Page 5). Furthermore, **none** of the tiers explicitly mention coverage for additional pet accommodation costs due to travel delays. These are significant gaps relative to the customer's requirements.

Given the "No Mix-and-Match" rule, the customer must choose one tier. Since the customer has a flexible budget and prioritizes comprehensive coverage for the aspects that *are* covered, the Preferred tier is recommended. Despite the unavoidable gaps regarding pre-existing conditions and pet accommodation within these standard plans, the Preferred tier provides the most substantial financial protection across all other requested areas (Trip Cancellation, Medical for unforeseen non-pre-existing issues, Scuba Diving, Luggage, Travel Delay) due to its significantly higher coverage limits compared to the Classic and Deluxe tiers.
