**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO Vital, Deluxe, and Elite tiers against the customer's requirements for a trip to Thailand:
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for travel to Japan and is therefore unsuitable for the customer's trip to Thailand.
*   **Vital:** This tier is inadequate as it explicitly excludes cover for 'Leisure Underwater Activities' (Section 28 N.A.), failing the critical Scuba Diving requirement. It also explicitly excludes cover for pre-existing medical conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation (Section 4), and likely excludes general treatment for them too, failing another key requirement. Limits are also significantly lower across the board.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier meets several requirements, including Trip Cancellation ($6k limit), Medical Expenses ($300k limit), Travel Delay ($1k limit), Luggage ($5k limit), and crucially, includes 'Leisure Underwater Activities' cover ($250k aggregate limit) for Scuba Diving. It also provides limited cover for pre-existing conditions, specifically for Emergency Medical Evacuation ($100k limit), although general treatment is likely excluded.
*   **Elite:** This tier also meets the core requirements with significantly higher limits: Trip Cancellation ($15k), Medical Expenses ($1M), Travel Delay ($2k), and Luggage ($8k). It includes 'Leisure Underwater Activities' cover with a higher aggregate limit ($350k). Similar to Deluxe, it offers limited cover for pre-existing conditions for Emergency Medical Evacuation ($150k limit), with general treatment likely excluded.

**Decision:** The customer requires *comprehensive* coverage, specifically mentioned Scuba Diving and a pre-existing condition (high blood pressure), and stated a *flexible budget* where the right cover is prioritized. While both Deluxe and Elite cover Scuba Diving, Elite offers substantially higher limits across all major categories (Medical, Cancellation, Luggage, Delay), better aligning with the 'comprehensive' need and flexible budget. Although neither tier fully covers the pre-existing condition for general treatment (only evacuation is mentioned with limits), Elite provides a higher limit for this specific evacuation benefit. The requirement for Pet Accommodation Coverage is not met by any SOMPO tier. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the Elite tier provides the best overall fit by offering the highest available protection levels for the covered requirements, especially the high-limit medical and specific Scuba Diving cover.

Therefore, the Elite tier is recommended as it provides the most comprehensive coverage levels, includes the essential Scuba Diving cover, and offers the highest available (though limited) protection related to the pre-existing condition via evacuation cover, aligning best with the customer's stated priorities and flexible budget.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides the highest coverage limits offered by SOMPO for key areas like Overseas Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), and Lost/Damaged Baggage ($8k).
    *   Includes specific coverage for 'Leisure Underwater Activities' (Section 28), explicitly meeting the Scuba Diving requirement with a high aggregate limit ($350k).
    *   Offers the highest available limit for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions ($150k for under 70s).
    *   High Travel Delay cash benefit limit ($2k).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Pet Accommodation Coverage: This specific requirement is Not Met as the policy does not include cover for additional cattery/kennel costs due to travel delays.
    *   Comprehensive Medical Coverage: Partially Met due to the limitation on pre-existing conditions; while general medical needs are covered up to $1M, treatment specifically for the declared high blood pressure is likely excluded, with cover limited to Emergency Evacuation/Repatriation only (up to $150k).
