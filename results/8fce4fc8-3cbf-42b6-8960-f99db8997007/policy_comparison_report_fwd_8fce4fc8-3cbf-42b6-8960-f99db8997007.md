**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers offer the core benefits requested, but require the purchase of optional add-ons for 'Pre-existing medical conditions' (due to the husband's high blood pressure) and 'Pet care' (for pet accommodation costs during delays). The key differentiators are the coverage limits and some included benefits.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $7,500 Trip Cancellation, $200k Overseas Medical base, $50k Pre-existing Medical add-on limit). While it covers the types of events, the limits might not meet the customer's need for "comprehensive" coverage, especially given the pre-existing condition. Car rental excess is an optional add-on.
*   **Business:** Provides significantly higher limits than Premium (e.g., $10,000 Trip Cancellation, $500k Overseas Medical base, $100k Pre-existing Medical add-on limit). Car rental excess is included in the base cover. This offers a good balance.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits across all major categories (e.g., $15,000 Trip Cancellation, $1M Overseas Medical base, $150k Pre-existing Medical add-on limit). Car rental excess is also included.

Given the customer's emphasis on *comprehensive* coverage, the desire for peace of mind regarding the pre-existing condition and scuba diving, and their stated *flexible budget* where the *right cover* is prioritized over cost, the First tier is the most suitable. It provides the highest benefit limits, particularly for medical expenses (both base and pre-existing conditions add-on) and trip cancellation, aligning best with the "comprehensive" requirement. Although Business offers substantial cover, First provides the maximum available protection under FWD's structure, fulfilling the customer's primary goal. The No Mix-and-Match rule means selecting a single tier, and First offers the best overall package for this customer's specific needs and priorities.
