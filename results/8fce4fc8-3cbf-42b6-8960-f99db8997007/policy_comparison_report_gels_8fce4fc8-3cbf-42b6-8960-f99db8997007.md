**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions (like the husband's high blood pressure), does not cover adventurous leisure activities (required for Scuba Diving), and lacks Pet Care coverage for additional accommodation costs.
*   **Gold:** This tier covers adventurous leisure activities (Scuba Diving) and Pet Care. It also offers an *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions. While it meets the core requirements *if the add-on is purchased*, its coverage limits (e.g., $500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $500 Pet Care) are lower than Platinum, and the delay trigger is longer (6 hours).
*   **Platinum:** This tier also covers adventurous leisure activities (Scuba Diving) and Pet Care, with higher limits ($800). Like Gold, it requires the *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions but offers higher limits for this coverage ($200k vs $150k for overseas medical related to pre-existing conditions). Platinum provides the highest overall limits (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation) and better delay triggers (4 hours vs 6 hours for travel/baggage delay).

Given the customer's requirements for *comprehensive* coverage, the inclusion of a pre-existing condition, participation in Scuba Diving, the need for Pet Care, and a stated *flexible budget* where the *right cover* is prioritized over cost, the Platinum tier (with the necessary pre-existing conditions add-on) is the most suitable. It offers the highest protection levels and best features among the available GELS tiers, directly addressing all specified needs including the crucial pre-existing condition coverage via the add-on. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must select a single tier, and only Gold and Platinum (with the add-on) meet all requirements; Platinum provides superior coverage levels aligning better with the customer's priorities.
