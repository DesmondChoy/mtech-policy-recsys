**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) for the customer's trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it lacks explicit coverage for hiking activities (a key requirement) and has the lowest overall limits. It also doesn't cover pre-existing conditions for medical evacuation.
*   **Deluxe:** Offers baseline coverage including hiking (trekking up to 3,500m) and core requirements like medical ($300k limit), cancellation ($6k limit), and luggage ($5k limit). It meets most needs but lacks Japan-specific features.
*   **GO Japan!:** Specifically designed for travel to Japan, this tier includes hiking coverage (trekking up to 3,500m) and offers a higher overseas medical limit ($500k) than Deluxe. Crucially, it provides access to a cashless medical network (740 clinics/hospitals) and a dedicated 24-Hour Medical Assistance hotline (EAJ) in Japan, directly addressing the customer's need for robust emergency medical support in the destination. Cancellation ($6k) and luggage ($5k) limits are the same as Deluxe.
*   **Elite:** Provides the highest limits ($1M medical, $15k cancellation, $8k luggage) and includes hiking coverage. However, it includes extra features not requested (e.g., Golf Cover) and is likely the most expensive option. While offering high limits, the specific Japan-focused benefits of the GO Japan! tier are more directly relevant to this customer's trip.

**Conclusion:** None of the tiers cover the specific request for "pet accommodation costs". The requirement for "additional accommodation costs due to travel delays" is primarily addressed via a per-hour cash benefit in all relevant tiers, rather than direct reimbursement, making it Partially Met across the board.

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the **GO Japan!** tier is recommended. It comprehensively covers the core requirements (medical, cancellation, luggage, travel delay cash benefit), explicitly includes the required hiking coverage, and offers significant, practical advantages for a trip *specifically to Japan* through its dedicated medical network and assistance hotline. It provides a better-tailored solution for this destination than Deluxe and is likely more cost-effective than Elite while still offering strong coverage limits ($500k medical).
