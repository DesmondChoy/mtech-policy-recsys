**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers against the customer's requirements for a comprehensive 2-week trip to Japan:

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest coverage limits (e.g., $200k Medical Overseas, $7.5k Trip Cancellation, $3k Baggage). While it covers the basic types of incidents requested, the limits, particularly for medical expenses in a country like Japan, may not align with the customer's desire for "comprehensive" and "fully covered" protection.
*   **Business:** Provides significantly higher limits than Premium (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Trip Cancellation, $5k Baggage), offering a good level of coverage.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits across all key areas (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Trip Cancellation, $7.5k Baggage, Unlimited Medical Evacuation). This aligns best with the customer's request for "comprehensive" coverage and explicit desire for medical expenses to be "fully" covered without issue.

All three tiers cover standard requirements like medical, cancellation, and luggage issues. Hiking as a leisure activity is not specifically excluded in the provided details and would typically be covered under the standard medical benefits of all tiers. Crucially, the specific requirement for "Pet accommodation costs" is available as an *optional add-on* ("Pet care") with the *same limit* across all three tiers (S$150 total, S$50 per 6 hours delay), meaning its availability doesn't differentiate the base tiers themselves, but the customer must purchase this add-on regardless of the chosen tier. The requirement for "additional accommodation costs due to travel delays" is only partially met by all tiers, as they offer a fixed cash benefit per delay period ("Travel Delay" benefit) rather than direct reimbursement of accommodation/meals for standard delays. "Trip Disruption" covers accommodation only under specific circumstances forcing an itinerary change.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must select one complete tier plus any desired add-ons), the choice hinges on which tier's base coverage levels best meet the "comprehensive" need. The First tier's significantly higher limits, especially for emergency medical treatment ($1M) and trip cancellation ($15k), provide the most robust protection, directly addressing the customer's emphasis on these areas. While Business offers good coverage, First provides a superior level of assurance aligning better with the customer's stated expectations for comprehensive protection. Therefore, the First tier is recommended, with the understanding that the "Pet care" add-on must be purchased separately.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: First

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides the highest coverage limits among FWD tiers for key areas like Emergency Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), and Baggage Loss/Damage ($7.5k), aligning with the customer's request for "comprehensive" cover.
    *   Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation.
    *   Covers medical expenses related to leisure hiking under the standard medical benefits.
    *   Offers the highest cash benefit limit for Travel Delays ($1000 max overseas).
    *   Pet accommodation cost coverage is available via an optional add-on.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Travel Delays: The benefit is a fixed cash payout per 6-hour block, not direct reimbursement for actual additional accommodation and meal costs as requested by the customer for standard delays.
    *   Pet Accommodation Costs: This coverage is not included by default and requires the purchase of a separate "Pet care" optional add-on with a relatively low limit (S$150).
