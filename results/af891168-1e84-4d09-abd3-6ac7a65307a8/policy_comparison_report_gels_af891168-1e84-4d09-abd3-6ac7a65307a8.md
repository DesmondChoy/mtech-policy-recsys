**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers against the customer's requirements:
*   **Basic Tier:** Fails to meet key requirements. It explicitly excludes coverage for "Adventurous leisure activities" (Page 5, Section 37), meaning hiking-related medical expenses would not be covered. Furthermore, it does not offer "Pet care" coverage (Page 5, Section 30) for additional pet accommodation costs due to travel delays.
*   **Gold Tier:** Meets all core requirements. It provides substantial coverage for "Medical expenses while overseas" (S$500,000), "Trip cancellation" (S$10,000), and "Baggage loss" (S$5,000). Crucially, it includes coverage for "Adventurous leisure activities" (Page 5, Item 37), which covers hiking, and provides "Pet care" coverage (S$500 limit) for additional pet accommodation costs due to covered delays (Page 5, Item 30). It also covers travel and baggage delays.
*   **Platinum Tier:** Also meets all core requirements, offering higher limits than the Gold tier (e.g., S$1,000,000 Medical, S$15,000 Cancellation, S$8,000 Baggage Loss, S$800 Pet Care) and slightly better delay triggers (payouts start after 4 hours instead of 6). It also covers "Adventurous leisure activities" including hiking.

Both the Gold and Platinum tiers fulfill all the customer's specified coverage types, including the emphasized requirements for hiking medical expenses and pet accommodation costs. The Gold tier provides comprehensive coverage that meets these needs. While the Platinum tier offers higher limits, the Gold tier adequately addresses all stated requirements. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. Since both Gold and Platinum are suitable in covering all required benefit types, the Tie-Breaking Rule is applied. Gold appears before Platinum in the price ranking (Cheapest to Most Expensive).

Therefore, the Gold tier is recommended as it is the most cost-effective option from GELS that holistically meets all the customer's specific requirements, including the crucial cover for hiking and pet accommodation costs.
