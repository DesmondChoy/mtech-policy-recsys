**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a family ski trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions (Section 4) and does not offer specific coverage for amateur sports like skiing (Page 2 Highlights & Page 5 Section 28).
*   **Deluxe:** Covers skiing (Amateur Sports Cover) and provides limited coverage for pre-existing conditions (Emergency Medical Evacuation up to $100k, Section 4). However, it has lower overall limits (e.g., $300k Medical, $6k Cancellation) and does not cover the requested pet accommodation.
*   **GO Japan!:** Also covers skiing and offers the same limited pre-existing condition coverage as Deluxe (Evacuation up to $100k, Section 4). It has higher medical limits ($500k) than Deluxe and offers Japan-specific cashless medical services, which is a benefit. However, its Trip Cancellation ($6k) and other limits are similar to Deluxe, and it also lacks pet accommodation coverage.
*   **Elite:** Covers skiing (Amateur Sports Cover Inclusion) and provides the highest available (though still limited) coverage for pre-existing conditions (Emergency Medical Evacuation up to $150k, Section 4). Crucially, it offers significantly higher limits across all other key areas requested by the customer: Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), Luggage Loss ($8k), and Travel Delay ($2k).

**Conclusion:** While no tier perfectly meets *all* requirements (specifically, full medical coverage for pre-existing conditions beyond evacuation, and pet accommodation), the Elite tier provides the best overall fit. It covers the essential skiing activity and offers the highest limits for medical emergencies, cancellation, delays, and luggage, aligning with the customer's stated priority of comprehensive protection and peace of mind over a strict budget ("More important to get the right cover... Get the protection we need"). The limitations regarding pre-existing conditions (evacuation only) and the lack of pet accommodation cover are consistent across Deluxe, GO Japan!, and Elite, making Elite the superior choice due to its higher benefit limits in other critical areas. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must accept the entire package of the chosen tier.
