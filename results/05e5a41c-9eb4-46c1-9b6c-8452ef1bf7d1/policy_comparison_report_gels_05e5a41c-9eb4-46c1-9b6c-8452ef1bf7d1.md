**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic Tier:** Fails to meet several critical requirements. It explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions (like high blood pressure), does not cover adventurous leisure activities (required for skiing), and lacks Pet Care coverage (for additional kennel fees). Therefore, it is unsuitable.
*   **Gold Tier:** Can meet the core requirements *only if* the optional Pre-existing Conditions Add-on Benefit is purchased. It covers general medical, cancellation, delays, luggage, adventurous activities (skiing), and pet care. However, the coverage limits are lower than Platinum (e.g., $500k overseas medical, $10k cancellation, $500 pet care). Delay triggers are also slower (6 hours).
*   **Platinum Tier:** Also requires the optional Pre-existing Conditions Add-on Benefit to cover the high blood pressure condition fully. It meets all requirements, including general medical, cancellation, delays, luggage, adventurous activities (skiing), and pet care. Crucially, it offers significantly higher coverage limits (e.g., $1M overseas medical, $15k cancellation, $800 pet care), faster delay triggers (4 hours), and includes specific Sports Equipment Cover ($1k) relevant to skiing, which Gold lacks.

The customer explicitly stated, "More important to get the right cover for peace of mind... Get the protection we need, that's the main thing," and indicated flexibility on budget. While both Gold and Platinum *can* meet the requirements with the add-on (satisfying the No Mix-and-Match rule), the Platinum tier's substantially higher limits and enhanced benefits (like faster delay triggers and sports equipment cover) align much better with the customer's stated priority for comprehensive protection and peace of mind, especially given the pre-existing condition and skiing activity. Therefore, Platinum is selected as the single most suitable tier, offering superior protection over Gold.
