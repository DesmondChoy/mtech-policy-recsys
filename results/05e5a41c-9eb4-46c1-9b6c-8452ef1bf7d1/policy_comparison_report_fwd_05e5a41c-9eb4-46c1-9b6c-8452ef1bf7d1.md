**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the family's trip to Japan:

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest coverage limits (e.g., S$200k Overseas Medical, S$7.5k Trip Cancellation). Crucially, the optional add-on for Pre-existing Medical Conditions only provides S$50k coverage overseas with a 50% co-payment for disruption/cancellation, which may not provide sufficient peace of mind for travel to Japan, especially involving skiing.
*   **Business:** Provides significantly better limits than Premium (e.g., S$500k Overseas Medical, S$10k Trip Cancellation). The Pre-existing Medical add-on offers S$100k overseas medical cover and S$10k cancellation (50% co-pay). This is a strong contender.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits across all categories (e.g., S$1M Overseas Medical, S$15k Trip Cancellation). The Pre-existing Medical add-on provides S$150k overseas medical cover and S$15k cancellation (50% co-pay).

All tiers require the purchase of optional add-ons for Pre-existing Conditions, Pet Care, and potentially Sports Equipment Protector (for equipment loss/damage, as medical/accident cover for leisure skiing is typically included in base medical/accident benefits). The No Mix-and-Match rule means the family must choose one tier and purchase the necessary add-ons within that tier.

Given the customer's stated priority for "peace of mind", especially regarding the pre-existing condition (high blood pressure) and skiing activity in Japan (where medical costs can be high), the higher limits offered by the **First** tier, particularly the S$150k for pre-existing medical expenses via the add-on, align best with this requirement. While the Business tier offers good coverage, the First tier provides a greater buffer and more comprehensive protection, directly addressing the customer's main concerns, even though it is the most expensive option. Therefore, First is recommended over Business as it is *more* suitable, not just equally suitable, negating the need for the price tie-breaker rule.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: First

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides the highest coverage limits across key areas like Overseas Medical (S$1M), Trip Cancellation (S$15k), and Luggage (S$7.5k).
    *   Offers the highest limit (S$150k) for Overseas Medical Expenses under the optional Pre-existing Conditions add-on, aligning well with the customer's priority for peace of mind regarding the high blood pressure condition during a trip to Japan involving skiing.
    *   Covers medical/accident aspects of leisure skiing under base benefits.
    *   Can cover all specified requirements (including pre-existing conditions, pet accommodation, and ski equipment) with the purchase of the necessary optional add-ons.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Requires the purchase of multiple optional add-ons ('Pre-existing medical conditions', 'Pet care', 'Sports equipment protector') to fully meet all requirements, which will increase the overall premium.
    *   This is the most expensive base tier among the options.
    *   The 'Pet care' add-on limit is relatively low (S$150).
    *   The 'Sports equipment protector' add-on excludes damage while the equipment is in use.
