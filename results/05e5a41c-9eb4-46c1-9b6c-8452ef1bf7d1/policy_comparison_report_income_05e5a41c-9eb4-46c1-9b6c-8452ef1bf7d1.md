**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All three standard tiers cover core requirements like general Medical Expenses, Trip Cancellation, Travel Delay, Luggage, and Skiing (under Adventurous Activities). However, they differ significantly in coverage limits. Preferred offers the highest limits across key areas: Medical Expenses Overseas ($1,000,000 vs $500,000 vs $250,000 for adults under 70), Trip Cancellation ($15,000 vs $10,000 vs $5,000 per person), and Loss/Damage of Baggage ($8,000 vs $5,000 vs $3,000 per person).

Crucially, none of the *standard* tiers provided (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred) appear to cover pre-existing medical conditions like high blood pressure; this is explicitly stated as an exclusion for standard plans in the Classic and Deluxe details and is assumed for the standard Preferred plan based on typical policy structures. Furthermore, none of the tiers explicitly list coverage for additional pet accommodation (kennel fees) due to travel delays.

Despite these significant gaps in the standard plans provided, the customer prioritized comprehensive protection and peace of mind over a strict budget, particularly mentioning the skiing and medical aspects. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (requiring selection of a single complete tier), the Preferred tier is recommended. It provides the most robust coverage levels for the requirements it *does* cover (general medical, cancellation, delay, luggage, skiing), aligning best with the customer's stated priority for strong protection. The critical gaps regarding pre-existing conditions and pet accommodation must be highlighted to the customer, who may need to inquire about specific riders or alternative plan types (e.g., plans with pre-existing condition coverage) not detailed in the provided standard tier information.
