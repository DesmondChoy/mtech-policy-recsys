**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** This tier is unsuitable as it completely lacks the specific 'Golfer's cover' required by the customer (Golf Equipment, Unused Green Fees, Hole-in-One Benefit). Crucially, it also explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions, failing to meet the need related to the declared high blood pressure.
*   **Gold:** This tier provides comprehensive core travel insurance benefits (Medical, Cancellation, Delay, Luggage) with reasonable limits. Importantly, it includes a dedicated 'Golfer's cover' section addressing the specific golf-related requirements. It also offers an *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure, which is essential for this customer. Personal Liability cover is included, which may address the golf buggy liability concern, albeit with some uncertainty.
*   **Platinum:** This tier offers the highest limits for all coverages, including the Golfer's cover benefits (higher equipment limit) and the optional pre-existing condition add-on (with potentially higher sub-limits). While it fully meets the requirements, the significantly higher limits might exceed the customer's needs and potentially their budget ($200-$300 for two travellers).

The **Gold** tier is recommended as the single most suitable option. It is the cheapest tier that meets *all* the specified coverage types, including the essential golf-specific benefits and the necessary option to cover the pre-existing condition (high blood pressure) via an add-on purchase. While Platinum offers higher limits, Gold provides substantial coverage that aligns well with the stated requirements and is more likely to fit within the customer's budget compared to Platinum. The No Mix-and-Match rule prevents taking golf cover from Gold/Platinum and combining it with Basic. Therefore, Gold represents the best balance of comprehensive required coverage and likely cost-effectiveness for this customer.
