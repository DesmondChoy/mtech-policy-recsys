**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the customer's golf trip to Thailand: All tiers cover core requirements like General Medical, Trip Cancellation, Travel Delays, and Lost/Damaged Luggage, but with varying limits. Crucially, none of the FWD tiers, even with optional add-ons, provide explicit coverage for all the customer's specific golf requirements: "Reimbursement for Unused Green Fees", "Golf Buggy Damage Liability", and "Hole-in-One Benefit".

Coverage for "Golf Equipment" is available across all tiers only via the purchase of the *optional* "Sports equipment protector" add-on ($2000 limit), which notably excludes damage occurring while the equipment is in use. Coverage for the declared "high blood pressure" pre-existing condition also requires purchasing the *optional* "Pre-existing medical conditions" add-on, available for all tiers but with different coverage limits.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must select one complete tier plus any necessary add-ons) and the fact that key golf requirements cannot be met by any FWD tier, the selection focuses on the tier providing the best coverage for the remaining requirements, especially considering the pre-existing condition.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits for core coverage (e.g., $200k Medical Overseas <70) and the pre-existing condition add-on (e.g., $50k Medical).
*   **Business:** Offers mid-range limits (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas <70) and better pre-existing condition add-on limits (e.g., $100k Medical).
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits for core coverage (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas <70, $15k Cancellation, $7.5k Luggage) and the highest limits for the pre-existing condition add-on (e.g., $150k Medical, $150k Evacuation). It also includes Car Rental Excess cover ($1000) in the base plan, unlike Premium where it's optional.

Therefore, the **First** tier is recommended. Although it fails to meet several specific golf requirements (a gap across all FWD tiers), it provides the most robust protection for general travel risks and the declared pre-existing medical condition (when the relevant add-on is purchased). This superior level of coverage for the requirements that *can* be met makes it the most suitable option among the available FWD tiers, despite being the highest priced according to the ranking. The customer *must* purchase the "Pre-existing medical conditions" and "Sports equipment protector" optional add-ons with this tier to cover those specific needs.
