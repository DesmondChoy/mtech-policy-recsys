**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a golf trip to Thailand:

1.  **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it lacks any specific golf coverage (Section 36 details not applicable or missing) and explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation (Section 4), which is critical given the customer's declared high blood pressure.
2.  **Deluxe:** While offering general travel cover and pre-existing condition cover for evacuation (up to $100k), the Deluxe tier's Golf Cover (Section 36) only includes Loss/Damage of Golf Equipment ($500). It explicitly states "N.A." (Not Applicable) for Hole-in-One, Unused Green Fees, and Damage of Buggy, failing to meet three key customer requirements.
3.  **GO Japan!:** This tier is immediately unsuitable as it is specifically designed for travel to Japan, while the customer's destination is Thailand. Furthermore, its golf coverage mirrors the Deluxe tier, only covering equipment loss and lacking the other specific golf benefits requested.
4.  **Elite:** This tier provides the most comprehensive coverage aligning with the customer's needs. Crucially, its dedicated Golf Cover (Section 36) includes limits for all requested items: Loss/Damage of Golf Equipment ($1000), Hole-in-One ($500), Unused Green Fees ($250), and Damage of Buggy ($500). It also offers the highest limits for general travel risks like Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), and Baggage Loss ($8k). Importantly, it includes Emergency Medical Evacuation cover for pre-existing conditions (up to $150k for under 70s).

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer cannot combine benefits from different tiers. Since only the Elite tier provides the full suite of specific golf coverages requested (Unused Green Fees, Buggy Damage Liability, Hole-in-One Benefit) in addition to Golf Equipment cover and robust general travel protection including pre-existing condition evacuation cover, it is the single most suitable option. The Tie-Breaking Rule was not needed as Elite is demonstrably superior in meeting the specific requirements compared to the other tiers. While potentially the most expensive, it is the only tier that holistically addresses the customer's stated needs, particularly the golf-specific ones.
