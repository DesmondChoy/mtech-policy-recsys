**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All tiers provide baseline coverage for the customer's core requirements like Trip Cancellation, Medical Expenses, Lost/Damaged Luggage, and Travel Delays, with limits increasing from Classic to Deluxe to Preferred. However, a critical part of the customer's request is specific, comprehensive golf coverage, including reimbursement for unused green fees, cover for damage to a rented golf buggy, and a hole-in-one benefit.

Critically, **none** of the available INCOME tiers (Classic, Deluxe, or Preferred) offer these specific golf-related benefits. Golf equipment is covered under the general 'Loss or damage of baggage and personal belongings' section in all tiers, but subject to a standard item limit ($500 per item/set/pair in Preferred) which may be insufficient for expensive clubs. Unused green fees, golf buggy damage liability (beyond standard personal liability to third parties or potential rental vehicle excess), and hole-in-one benefits are not mentioned and therefore not covered by any of the three tiers.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must choose one complete tier) and the fact that the specific golf requirements cannot be met by any single tier, the decision defaults to selecting the tier that best covers the *other* stated requirements (Cancellation, Medical, Luggage, Delay) most comprehensively, aligning with the customer's desire for robust coverage and flexible budget.

The **Preferred** tier offers the highest limits across all core categories:
*   Trip Cancellation: $15,000 (vs $10k Deluxe, $5k Classic)
*   Medical Expenses Overseas: $1,000,000 (vs $500k Deluxe, $250k Classic)
*   Lost/Damaged Luggage: $8,000 overall (vs $5k Deluxe, $3k Classic)
*   Travel Delay: $2,000 overall (vs $1.5k Deluxe, $1k Classic)

Therefore, despite its inability to meet the specific additional golf requests, the **Preferred** tier is recommended as the *most suitable* option among the three available. It provides the highest level of protection for the essential travel risks explicitly requested by the customer, offering greater peace of mind compared to the lower tiers, even though it fails to deliver the specialized golf coverage desired.

*   **Policy Coverage:** N/A (Benefit not listed in policy details)
    *   **Base Limits:** N/A
