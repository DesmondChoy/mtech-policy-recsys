**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO policy tiers (Vital, GO Japan!, Deluxe, Elite) against the customer's requirements, particularly the emphasis on comprehensive golf coverage:
*   **Vital:** Lacks any specific golf-related coverage (equipment, green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one). It only provides basic travel insurance benefits.
*   **GO Japan!:** Offers cover for Loss/Damage of Golf Equipment ($500 limit) but explicitly states Hole-in-one, Unused Green Fees, and Damage of Buggy are Not Applicable (N.A.). While tailored for Japan travel with features like cashless medical, it fails on the specific additional golf requests.
*   **Deluxe:** Similar to GO Japan!, it covers Loss/Damage of Golf Equipment ($500 limit) but explicitly states Hole-in-one, Unused Green Fees, and Damage of Buggy are Not Applicable (N.A.). It does not meet the customer's specific golf needs beyond basic equipment loss.
*   **Elite:** This is the only tier that includes a dedicated 'Golf Cover' section (Section 36) which addresses all the customer's specific requests: Loss/Damage of Golf Equipment ($1000), Hole-in-one benefit ($500), Unused Green Fees ($250), and Damage of Buggy ($500). It also provides the highest limits across core coverage areas like Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), and Baggage ($8k).

Given the customer's explicit and non-negotiable requirement for comprehensive golf coverage, including unused green fees, buggy damage liability, and a hole-in-one benefit, and adhering to the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must select one complete tier), the Elite tier is the only option that fulfills all stated needs. The other tiers fundamentally lack the specific golf benefits requested. Therefore, the Elite tier is recommended as the most suitable choice.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides comprehensive coverage for all specific golf-related requirements (equipment, unused green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one) via the dedicated Golf Cover section, which other tiers lack.
    *   Offers the highest coverage limits among the tiers for core benefits like Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), Baggage ($8k), and Travel Delay ($2k).
    *   Includes Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for travellers up to 70 years old.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Golf Equipment Coverage: The $1000 limit for loss/damage might be insufficient for high-value golf clubs.
    *   Defined benefit for a hole-in-one: The benefit is specified for hole-in-ones achieved "during a competition", which may not cover casual play.
