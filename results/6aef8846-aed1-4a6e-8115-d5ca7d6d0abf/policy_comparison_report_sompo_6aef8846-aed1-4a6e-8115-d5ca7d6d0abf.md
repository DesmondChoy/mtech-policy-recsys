**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO Vital, GO Japan!, Deluxe, and Elite tiers against the customer's requirements, particularly the emphasis on comprehensive golf coverage:
*   **Vital:** Provides basic coverage for core needs like Trip Cancellation ($5k) and Medical ($150k) but completely lacks any specific provisions for golf activities (equipment, green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one). This makes it unsuitable.
*   **GO Japan!:** While tailored for Japan with good medical limits ($500k) and cashless options, its Golf Cover (Section 36) only includes loss/damage to equipment ($500) and explicitly excludes (N.A.) unused green fees, hole-in-one benefits, and buggy damage cover. This fails to meet the customer's specific, emphasized golf needs.
*   **Deluxe:** Offers improved core limits over Vital (e.g., $6k Cancellation, $300k Medical). However, similar to GO Japan!, its Golf Cover (Section 36) only addresses equipment loss ($500) and explicitly excludes (N.A.) the other critical golf requirements (unused green fees, hole-in-one, buggy damage).
*   **Elite:** Provides the highest limits for core requirements (e.g., $15k Cancellation, $1M Medical Overseas, $8k Baggage). Crucially, it is the *only* tier featuring a comprehensive 'Golf Cover' section (Section 36) that addresses all the customer's specific requests: loss/damage to golf equipment ($1000), reimbursement for unused green fees ($250), cover for damage to a rented golf buggy ($500), and a hole-in-one benefit ($500).

Given the customer's explicit prioritization of comprehensive golf coverage ("This is the main point...", "I want *proper* golf coverage...") and flexibility on budget, and considering the No Mix-and-Match rule (requiring selection of a single complete tier), the Elite tier is the only option from SOMPO that holistically meets all stated requirements.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met. The tier provides a $500 benefit for a hole-in-one, meeting the request for a defined benefit. However, the source detail specifies this covers "celebration costs for a hole-in-one achieved during a competition". The customer did not specify if their golf play would be part of a competition, so this condition represents a potential limitation/gap compared to the general request.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides comprehensive and specific coverage for all requested golf-related needs (equipment, unused green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one) via the dedicated Golf Cover section (Section 36).
    *   Offers the highest coverage limits among the SOMPO tiers for core requirements like Medical Expenses ($1M Overseas), Trip Cancellation ($15k), Lost/Damaged Luggage ($8k), and Travel Delay ($2k).
    *   Includes Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for the customer's age group.
    *   Covers Amateur Sports, which includes golf.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Defined benefit for a hole-in-one: The $500 benefit is conditional on the hole-in-one being achieved during a competition, which may not align with the customer's plans.
