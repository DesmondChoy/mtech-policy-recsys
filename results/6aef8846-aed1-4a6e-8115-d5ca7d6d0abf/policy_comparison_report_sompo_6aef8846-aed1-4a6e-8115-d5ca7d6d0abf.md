**Recommended Tier:** Elite

**Justification:**

The **Elite** tier is recommended as the single most suitable option because it is the *only* tier among the provided SOMPO TravelJoy plans that comprehensively addresses all the customer's stated requirements, particularly the emphasized and specific needs related to golf activities.

1.  **Comprehensive Golf Coverage:** The customer explicitly requested coverage for golf equipment, reimbursement for unused green fees due to injury, cover for damage to a rented golf buggy, and a hole-in-one benefit. The Elite tier is the sole plan that includes specific provisions for all these elements under its "Golf Cover" section (Section 36). The Vital, Deluxe, and GO Japan! tiers explicitly state "N.A." (Not Applicable) for unused green fees, buggy damage, and hole-in-one benefits, only offering basic equipment loss/damage cover (or none in Vital's case).
2.  **Meeting Core Requirements:** Beyond golf, the Elite tier provides the highest limits for the customer's other core requirements: Trip Cancellation ($15,000), Medical Expenses Overseas ($1,000,000), Lost/Damaged Luggage ($8,000), and Travel Delays (up to $2,000). These high limits align with the customer's desire for comprehensive coverage and peace of mind.
3.  **Customer Priority:** The customer explicitly stated that budget was flexible and comprehensive coverage meeting their detailed requirements was the priority, especially after a previous negative experience. While Elite is the most expensive tier, it directly fulfills this prioritization by offering the necessary specific coverages that lower tiers lack.

Therefore, despite being the highest-priced option, the Elite tier is the only one that holistically meets the customer's non-negotiable requirements, making it the most suitable choice. The tie-breaking rule was not needed as Elite was clearly superior in meeting the specific requirements compared to the other tiers.

    *   **Specific Golf Limits:** While covered, the limits for unused green fees ($250), hole-in-one ($500), and buggy damage ($500) might be lower than the actual costs incurred, depending on the circumstances.
    *   **Complexity:** Higher tiers often come with more detailed terms and conditions that need careful review.
