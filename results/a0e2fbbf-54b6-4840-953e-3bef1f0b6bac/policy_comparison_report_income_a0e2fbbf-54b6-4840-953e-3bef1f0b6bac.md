**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers against the customer's requirements:

1.  **Pre-existing Condition (Asthma):** A critical requirement is "full medical coverage for emergencies" related to Asthma. Based on the provided policy details, all three standard tiers (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred) explicitly state or imply they *do not* cover pre-existing medical conditions. This is a significant gap across all available standard options presented. The customer should be advised that these standard plans likely won't cover Asthma-related emergencies and they may need to seek a specialized plan or rider if available from INCOME, which falls outside the scope of these standard tier details.
2.  **Accidental Death (Public Transport Double Cover):** The customer specifically requested double payout for accidental death on public transport. The Classic tier explicitly states this is "NA" (Not Available). Both the Deluxe and Preferred tiers include this benefit (Section 13, Conditional Limits). This eliminates the Classic tier from consideration.
3.  **Sports Coverage (White Water Rafting):** All tiers include coverage for 'Adventurous Activities'. While Deluxe and Preferred explicitly list White Water Rafting as an example, the Classic tier's general description likely covers it under 'water activities' provided safety rules are followed. Therefore, both Deluxe and Preferred meet this requirement clearly.
4.  **Other Coverage Levels (Medical, Cancellation, Luggage, Delay):** Both Deluxe and Preferred cover Trip Cancellation, Travel Delay, and Lost/Damaged Luggage, but Preferred offers significantly higher limits across these categories (e.g., Medical Overseas $1M vs $500k; Cancellation $15k vs $10k; Luggage $8k vs $5k for an adult under 70).
5.  **Holistic Choice & No Mix-and-Match:** Since coverages cannot be mixed, and Classic fails on a key requirement (Public Transport Double Cover), the choice is between Deluxe and Preferred. Although both fail to cover the pre-existing condition based on the provided standard plan details, the customer requested "comprehensive" insurance and "full medical coverage". The Preferred tier, with its substantially higher limits for medical, cancellation, luggage, and accidental death, aligns better with the request for comprehensive and high-level coverage compared to the Deluxe tier.

Therefore, the **Preferred** tier is recommended as it meets the specific requirement for Public Transport Double Cover and offers the highest available limits for other key areas like medical, cancellation, and luggage, best matching the customer's desire for comprehensive coverage, despite the significant caveat regarding the lack of pre-existing condition coverage in these standard plans.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Preferred

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides the highest available limits for Medical Expenses ($1M adult <70), Trip Cancellation ($15k), and Lost/Damaged Luggage ($8k), aligning with the request for comprehensive coverage.
    *   Includes Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for adults under 70.
    *   Covers the specific requirement for double payout ($1M adult <70) for Accidental Death on Public Transport.
    *   Clearly covers White Water Rafting under Adventurous Activities.
    *   Includes COVID-19 coverage for relevant sections (excluding medical expenses in Singapore).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Medical Coverage: Critically, this standard plan does *not* cover pre-existing conditions like Asthma, failing to meet the customer's specific requirement for coverage related to this condition. This is a major gap that needs to be addressed, potentially via a different product or rider not detailed here.
