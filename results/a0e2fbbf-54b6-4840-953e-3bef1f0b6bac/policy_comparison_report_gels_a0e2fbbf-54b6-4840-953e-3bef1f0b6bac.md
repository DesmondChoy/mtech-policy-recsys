**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** Fails to meet several critical requirements. It explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions (like Asthma), adventurous activities (like White Water Rafting), and public transport double indemnity. Therefore, it is unsuitable.
*   **Gold:** Covers adventurous activities and public transport double indemnity. It *can* cover the pre-existing condition (Asthma) for medical emergencies and trip cancellation/disruption, but *only* if an optional pre-existing conditions add-on benefit is purchased (at additional cost). This add-on has specific limits (e.g., $150k for overseas medical) and co-payments (e.g., 50% for cancellation). Travel delay payout starts after 6 hours.
*   **Platinum:** Also covers adventurous activities and public transport double indemnity, but with higher limits than Gold (e.g., $1M vs $500k for double indemnity). Like Gold, it requires the purchase of the optional pre-existing conditions add-on benefit to cover Asthma-related issues, but offers higher limits within this add-on (e.g., $200k vs $150k for overseas medical). It also provides higher base limits for standard medical, cancellation, and luggage, and a better travel delay trigger (payout after 4 hours vs 6 hours).

The customer requires comprehensive coverage, specifically mentioning "full medical coverage for emergencies" including Asthma, White Water Rafting cover, and public transport double indemnity. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must choose one complete tier plus any add-ons), Basic is eliminated. While both Gold and Platinum require the add-on for Asthma coverage, Platinum provides significantly higher limits overall and specifically a higher limit for the critical pre-existing condition medical cover ($200k vs $150k), better aligning with the customer's request for robust protection. The improved travel delay trigger is also beneficial. Therefore, Platinum (assuming the necessary pre-existing condition add-on is purchased) is the most suitable tier as it offers the highest level of coverage for the specified requirements. The price tie-breaking rule was not needed as Platinum offers superior coverage alignment compared to Gold for this customer's specific needs.
