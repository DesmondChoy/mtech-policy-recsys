**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers offer core coverage like Medical, Cancellation, Delay, and Luggage, and all require the purchase of an optional 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on to cover the customer's Asthma. However, they differ significantly in coverage limits.

*   **Medical & Pre-existing Conditions:** The customer stressed the need for "full medical coverage for emergencies," especially for Asthma. The First tier provides the highest limits for both general overseas medical expenses ($1,000,000 for age <70) and medical expenses related to the pre-existing condition add-on ($150,000). Business offers lower limits ($500k general, $100k pre-existing), and Premium is significantly lower ($200k general, $50k pre-existing medical, although pre-existing evacuation is Unlimited). Given the customer's emphasis, First tier's higher medical limits offer the most robust protection.
*   **Other Key Coverages:** First tier also consistently offers the highest limits for Trip Cancellation ($15,000), Travel Delay ($1,000), and Lost/Damaged Luggage ($7,500) compared to Business and Premium tiers.
*   **Accidental Death on Public Transport:** The specific requirement for a *double* payout for accidental death on public transport is not explicitly confirmed in the provided policy details for *any* tier (Premium, Business, or First). All tiers include standard Personal Accident coverage (First: $400,000 for age <70), but lack the specific public transport enhancement detail in the JSON data. As this specific feature isn't met by any available tier based on the data, the decision focuses on the best fit for other critical requirements.
*   **Sports Coverage:** Recreational White Water Rafting is generally covered under standard medical and personal accident benefits in travel insurance unless specifically listed as an excluded extreme activity. Assuming recreational participation, all tiers should provide this cover.
*   **No Mix-and-Match:** Since coverages cannot be combined across tiers, the customer must choose the single tier that best meets their overall needs.

Therefore, the **First** tier is recommended. It provides the most comprehensive coverage with the highest limits, particularly for the critical medical and pre-existing condition requirements, aligning best with the customer's request for "full" and "comprehensive" protection, despite the lack of confirmation for the specific public transport double payout detail and potential budget considerations (price data not provided).
