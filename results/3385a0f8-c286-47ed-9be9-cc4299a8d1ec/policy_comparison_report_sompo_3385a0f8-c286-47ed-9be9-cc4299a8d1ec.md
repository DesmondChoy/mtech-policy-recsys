**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against Mr. Tan's requirements for his golf trip to Australia:

1.  **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for travel to Japan and is therefore unsuitable for a trip to Australia.
2.  **Vital:** This is the most basic tier and completely lacks the specific golf-related coverages (equipment, unused green fees, buggy liability, hole-in-one benefit) that are crucial requirements for Mr. Tan. It also offers the lowest limits for core benefits like medical and trip cancellation.
3.  **Deluxe:** This tier offers intermediate coverage. While it includes cover for loss/damage to golf equipment (Section 36, $500 limit), it explicitly states "N.A." (Not Applicable) for the other critical golf requirements: unused green fees, damage to buggy, and the hole-in-one benefit.
4.  **Elite:** This is the highest tier and the *only* one that includes a dedicated 'Golf Cover' section (Section 36) addressing all of Mr. Tan's specific golf-related needs: loss/damage to equipment ($1000), reimbursement for unused green fees ($250), liability for damage to a rental golf buggy ($500), and a hole-in-one benefit ($500). Furthermore, it provides the highest coverage limits across core areas like emergency medical expenses ($1,000,000), trip cancellation ($15,000), and baggage loss ($8,000), aligning with the customer's request for "comprehensive" and "watertight" coverage.

Given the "No Mix-and-Match" rule (the customer must select one complete tier) and the explicit requirement for multiple specific golf benefits, the Elite tier is the only suitable option from SOMPO that meets all stated needs. The other tiers fail to cover essential golf-related aspects requested by the customer. Therefore, the Elite tier is recommended despite being the most expensive, as it provides the necessary comprehensive coverage. The Tie-Breaking Rule was not needed as Elite was the only tier meeting the core requirements.
