**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for Mr. Tan's golf trip to Australia:

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits for core coverage like Medical Expenses (S$200k), Trip Cancellation (S$7.5k), and Baggage (S$3k). It requires optional add-ons for both Sports Equipment and Car Rental Excess.
*   **Business:** Provides mid-range limits (Medical S$500k, Cancellation S$10k, Baggage S$5k) and includes Car Rental Excess cover (S$500). It still requires the optional Sports Equipment add-on.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits for core coverage (Medical S$1M for under 70s, Cancellation S$15k, Baggage S$7.5k) and includes a higher Car Rental Excess limit (S$1000). Like the others, it requires the optional Sports Equipment add-on for golf club coverage.

Crucially, none of the FWD tiers specifically cover reimbursement for unused green fees, liability for golf buggies (likely excluded under Personal Liability's motorised vehicle exclusion), or a hole-in-one benefit, based on the provided policy details. Furthermore, coverage for golf equipment itself necessitates purchasing the *optional* 'Sports equipment protector' add-on across all tiers; it is not included in the base baggage cover.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (Mr. Tan must choose one complete tier plus any desired add-ons), and the fact that several specific golf requirements cannot be met by any tier, the best recommendation focuses on providing the most robust coverage for the requirements that *can* be met. The customer emphasized needing "comprehensive" and "watertight" coverage. The **First** tier aligns best with this request due to its significantly higher limits for essential coverages like Emergency Medical Expenses, Trip Cancellation, Baggage, and Trip Disruption compared to the Premium and Business tiers. While it doesn't meet all specific golf requests, it provides the strongest foundation for the standard travel risks and includes the highest Car Rental Excess cover among the tiers. The need to purchase the optional 'Sports equipment protector' add-on applies regardless of the chosen tier.

Therefore, the First tier is recommended as it offers the highest level of protection for the core travel insurance needs, best matching the customer's desire for comprehensive coverage, despite the identified gaps in specific golf-related benefits which are not covered by any FWD tier.
