**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All tiers provide core coverage for trip cancellation, medical expenses, luggage issues, and travel delays, with limits increasing from Classic to Preferred. Golf as an activity is covered under 'Adventurous Activities' in all plans. However, the customer has several specific golf-related requirements that are not explicitly addressed by any tier.

*   **Classic:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., S$5k cancellation, S$250k medical, S$3k baggage). It lacks specific golf benefits like unused green fee reimbursement, hole-in-one cover, or explicit golf buggy liability cover. Golf equipment falls under the standard S$500 per item baggage limit.
*   **Deluxe:** Offers higher limits than Classic (e.g., S$10k cancellation, S$500k medical, S$5k baggage) and includes unlimited evacuation/repatriation for under 70s. However, it also lacks the specific golf benefits requested. Golf equipment is still subject to the S$500 per item limit.
*   **Preferred:** Provides the highest limits across all core categories (e.g., S$15k cancellation, S$1M medical, S$8k baggage) and includes unlimited evacuation/repatriation for under 70s. While it *still* does not offer explicit coverage for unused green fees, hole-in-one benefits, or guaranteed golf buggy liability, its higher overall baggage limit (S$8,000) provides slightly better potential coverage for golf equipment loss/damage compared to Classic and Deluxe, although the S$500 per item limit remains a significant constraint.

Given the customer's emphasis on "comprehensive" and "watertight" coverage, and the No Mix-and-Match rule preventing the addition of missing benefits, the Preferred tier is recommended. Although it fails to meet several specific golf requirements, it offers the highest available protection within INCOME for the standard travel risks (medical, cancellation, luggage, delays) and the highest baggage limit which partially addresses the golf equipment concern. The significant gaps in specific golf coverage must be noted.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Golf equipment is covered under general baggage, but the limit of S$500 per item/set/pair is likely insufficient for expensive golf clubs. The overall limit is S$8,000.

### Requirement: reimbursement for unused green fees

*   **Policy Coverage:** [No specific benefit found in policy data]
    *   **Base Limits:** N/A
