**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All tiers provide core coverage for Trip Cancellation, Emergency Medical Expenses, Luggage Protection, Travel Delay, and Adventurous Activities (including Scuba Diving under specific conditions). However, they differ significantly in coverage limits and specific features.

*   **Classic:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $5k Cancellation, $250k Medical for under 70s) and crucially **does not include** the customer's specific requirement for a "Double payout for accidental death on public transport".
*   **Deluxe:** Provides higher limits than Classic (e.g., $10k Cancellation, $500k Medical for under 70s) and **includes** the requested double payout feature. It covers Scuba Diving.
*   **Preferred:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $15k Cancellation, $1M Medical for under 70s, $8k Luggage) and also **includes** the requested double payout feature. It covers Scuba Diving.

A critical point across all standard tiers (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred) is that they **do not cover pre-existing medical conditions**, such as the customer's asthma. This is a significant gap relative to the requirement.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. Classic is unsuitable as it fails the double payout requirement. Both Deluxe and Preferred meet this specific request and cover Scuba Diving. However, the customer emphasized needing "comprehensive" medical coverage and expressed significant anxiety about potential issues. The Preferred tier, with its substantially higher limits (especially the $1,000,000 overseas medical cover compared to Deluxe's $500,000), aligns better with the desire for comprehensive protection, particularly for travel to an expensive destination like Japan.

Therefore, the **Preferred** tier is recommended as it meets all specific feature requests (double payout, scuba) while offering the highest available limits for core coverage areas like medical and cancellation, best addressing the customer's need for comprehensive protection, despite the unavoidable exclusion of pre-existing conditions in these standard plans.
