**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under the Emergency Medical Evacuation benefit (Section 4, N.A.) and does not provide cover for Leisure Underwater Activities (Section 28, N.A.), failing to meet the customer's needs regarding Asthma and Scuba Diving.
*   **Deluxe:** Offers baseline coverage for Scuba Diving (Section 28, $250k aggregate limit) and provides Emergency Medical Evacuation cover for pre-existing conditions up to $100k (Section 4). However, its overall medical ($300k) and cancellation ($6k) limits are lower.
*   **GO Japan!:** Similar to Deluxe regarding Scuba ($250k aggregate) and pre-existing evacuation cover ($100k). It offers higher overseas medical limits ($500k) than Deluxe and includes Japan-specific cashless medical services, which is beneficial. However, its other limits (Cancellation $6k, Luggage $5k) are the same as Deluxe.
*   **Elite:** Provides the highest coverage levels across all key areas: $1M for Overseas Medical Expenses, $15k for Trip Cancellation, $8k for Luggage, and Unlimited Medical Evacuation (non-pre-existing). Crucially for this customer, it offers the highest available cover for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions ($150k) and the highest aggregate limit for Leisure Underwater Activities including Scuba Diving ($350k).

While GO Japan! offers useful cashless services in Japan, the Elite tier's significantly higher limits, particularly for medical coverage and the specific cover for pre-existing condition evacuation and scuba diving, better align with the customer's stated need for "comprehensive medical coverage," concern about the pre-existing Asthma condition, and planned Scuba Diving activity. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose the tier that best covers *all* critical requirements.

Therefore, the **Elite** tier is recommended as it provides the most robust coverage for the customer's specific needs (high medical limits, highest pre-existing condition evacuation cover, highest scuba cover), despite being the most expensive option. It's important to note that the specific request for a "Double payout for accidental death on public transport" is **not met** by any of the available SOMPO tiers based on the provided policy details.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Highest available limits for Overseas Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), Luggage ($8k), and Travel Delay ($2k max).
    *   Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation for non-pre-existing conditions (under 70s).
    *   Highest available specific cover for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions ($150k for under 70s).
    *   Highest available aggregate limit ($350k) covering Leisure Underwater Activities, including Scuba Diving.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   The specific request for a "Double payout for accidental death on public transport" is not met by this tier (or any other SOMPO tier based on the data).
    *   While Emergency Medical Evacuation for pre-existing conditions (Asthma) is covered up to $150k, general overseas medical expenses (doctor visits, non-emergency hospital stays) related to Asthma are likely excluded unless it constitutes a life-threatening emergency.
    *   This is the most expensive tier among the options.
