**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for this customer: All tiers cover the basic requirements like cancellation, medical, luggage, and travel delay, and offer an optional add-on for pre-existing conditions (necessary for the customer's asthma). However, they differ significantly in coverage limits and specific conditions, particularly for the crucial medical and pre-existing condition requirements.

*   **Premium:** While being the cheapest, its pre-existing medical expense coverage is weak, offering only $50,000 limit *with* a 50% co-payment. This is insufficient given the customer's explicit concern about comprehensive medical cover and potential asthma-related issues in Japan. Core limits are also the lowest ($7.5k Cancellation, $200k Medical, $3k Luggage).
*   **Business:** Offers a significant step up with $100,000 pre-existing medical expense cover (no co-payment mentioned for medical expenses) and $100,000 for pre-existing evacuation. Core limits are good ($10k Cancellation, $500k Medical, $5k Luggage).
*   **First:** Provides the highest level of protection. It offers $150,000 for pre-existing medical expenses (no co-payment mentioned for medical expenses) and $150,000 for pre-existing evacuation. Its core limits are also the most generous ($15k Cancellation, $1M Medical, $7.5k Luggage).

The customer emphasized the need for *comprehensive* medical coverage, expressed significant anxiety about potential medical costs overseas ("Japan is expensive", "hospital bills... I can't even imagine"), and specifically mentioned asthma. Given these factors and the No Mix-and-Match rule (requiring selection of a single tier), the First tier is the most suitable. Its superior medical limits, especially for the pre-existing condition without a co-payment on medical expenses, best address the customer's primary concerns and provide the highest level of assurance, despite being the most expensive option. The specific request for a double payout on public transport accidental death is not met by any FWD tier based on the provided data.

Therefore, the First tier is recommended because it offers the most comprehensive coverage, particularly for the critical medical and pre-existing condition needs highlighted by the customer.
