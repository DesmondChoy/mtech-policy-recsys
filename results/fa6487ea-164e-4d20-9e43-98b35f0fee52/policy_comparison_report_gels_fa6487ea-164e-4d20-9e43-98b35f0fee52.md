**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers against the customer's requirements:
*   **Basic Tier:** Fails to meet several key requirements. It explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions like Asthma, does not cover adventurous leisure activities like Scuba Diving, and lacks the requested Public Transport Double Indemnity benefit. Therefore, it is unsuitable.
*   **Gold Tier:** Meets all core requirements: Trip Cancellation, Emergency Medical, Luggage Protection, and Travel Delay. Crucially, it offers the required Public Transport Double Indemnity and covers Adventurous Leisure Activities (including Scuba Diving). It also provides an *optional add-on* benefit to cover pre-existing conditions like Asthma for medical expenses, evacuation, and trip disruption/cancellation (subject to specific limits and co-payments).
*   **Platinum Tier:** Also meets all core requirements and specific requests, generally offering higher coverage limits than the Gold tier (e.g., higher medical, cancellation, luggage limits, and a shorter 4-hour trigger for travel delay vs. 6 hours for Gold). It also offers the same *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions with slightly higher limits than the Gold add-on.

Both Gold and Platinum tiers can meet the customer's stated requirements, provided the optional pre-existing conditions add-on is purchased. The customer requested "comprehensive" coverage but did not specify minimum limits that only Platinum would satisfy. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must choose one complete tier), both Gold and Platinum present viable complete packages.

Since both Gold and Platinum tiers are deemed suitable for meeting the explicit requirements (including the crucial pre-existing condition via add-on, scuba diving, and public transport double indemnity), the Tie-Breaking Rule is applied. The rule states to select the cheapest among equally suitable options. Based on the provided price ranking (Basic < Gold < Platinum), the Gold tier is selected.

Therefore, the Gold tier is recommended as it comprehensively meets all the customer's requirements (including the specific requests for scuba diving, public transport double indemnity, and the ability to cover the pre-existing condition via an add-on) and is the more cost-effective option compared to the similarly suitable Platinum tier, according to the tie-breaking rule.
