**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers: The Basic tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions (a key requirement for the husband's high blood pressure) and does not offer Pet Care coverage for additional accommodation costs. Both the Gold and Platinum tiers can meet the core requirements, including medical cover for pre-existing conditions, hiking, trip cancellation (including for pre-existing conditions), travel delays, and pet care, *provided the optional Pre-existing Conditions Add-on Benefit is purchased*.

The Gold tier offers substantial coverage ($500k medical, $10k cancellation, $5k luggage, $500 pet care, 6hr delay trigger). However, the Platinum tier provides significantly higher limits ($1M medical, $15k cancellation, $8k luggage, $800 pet care) and better travel delay terms (payout trigger after 4 hours instead of 6).

Given the customer's flexible budget and stated emphasis on "comprehensive coverage for peace of mind," the Platinum tier is the single most suitable option. It offers the highest available limits across all key areas (Medical, Cancellation, Luggage, Pet Care) and superior travel delay benefits, best aligning with the desire for maximum reassurance. The No Mix-and-Match rule necessitates choosing a single tier, and Platinum provides the most comprehensive package overall, justifying the higher premium tier for this customer's priorities, assuming the essential Pre-existing Conditions Add-on is included.
