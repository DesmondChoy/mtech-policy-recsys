**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All tiers cover core requirements like Trip Cancellation, Travel Delay, Lost/Damaged Luggage, and Hiking (under Adventurous Activities). However, they differ significantly in coverage limits. Classic offers the lowest limits (e.g., $250k Medical Overseas, $5k Cancellation, $3k Luggage). Deluxe provides mid-range limits (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage). Preferred offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage), aligning best with the customer's stated priority for "comprehensive coverage for peace of mind" and a flexible budget.

Crucially, none of the standard tiers provided (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred) explicitly cover pre-existing medical conditions like high blood pressure based on the provided policy details ("Standard plans do not cover pre-existing medical conditions" noted for Classic/Deluxe, and assumed standard for Preferred unless stated otherwise). Furthermore, none of the tiers specifically list coverage for "Additional Pet Accommodation" costs due to travel delays.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must select one complete tier), and the emphasis on comprehensive coverage, the Preferred tier is recommended. While it fails to meet the pre-existing condition and pet accommodation requirements under its standard terms, it provides the most robust protection across all other key areas (Medical, Cancellation, Luggage, Delay) compared to the Classic and Deluxe tiers from INCOME. The significantly higher limits offer greater peace of mind for other potential issues during the 3-week trip to Japan. The customer should be explicitly advised about the lack of coverage for the pre-existing condition and pet accommodation within this standard plan and may need to inquire about specific riders or alternative policies if these are absolute must-haves.
