**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a 3-week trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable primarily because it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under the Emergency Medical Evacuation benefit (Section 4), which is a critical requirement for the customer due to the husband's high blood pressure. It also lacks specific confirmation of hiking coverage found in other tiers and has the lowest overall limits.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier meets several key requirements, including Emergency Medical Evacuation cover for pre-existing conditions (up to $100k) and hiking coverage (trekking up to 3,500m). However, its coverage limits for medical ($300k), cancellation ($6k), and luggage ($5k) are lower than Elite. It also lacks explicit mention of pet accommodation coverage.
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is similar to Deluxe but offers higher overseas medical coverage ($500k) and Japan-specific cashless medical services. It provides the same pre-existing condition evacuation limit ($100k) and hiking cover as Deluxe. While the Japan-specific features are relevant, its cancellation ($6k) and luggage ($5k) limits are still significantly lower than Elite, and it also lacks explicit pet accommodation coverage.
*   **Elite:** This tier offers the most comprehensive coverage and highest limits across all key areas requested by the customer. It provides the highest medical cover ($1M), the highest evacuation limit for pre-existing conditions ($150k), the highest luggage limit ($8k), the highest trip cancellation limit ($15k), and the highest travel delay limit ($2k). It also explicitly covers hiking (trekking up to 3,500m). While none of the provided policy extracts explicitly mention coverage for additional pet accommodation costs due to travel delays, Elite best aligns with the customer's stated preference for "comprehensive coverage for peace of mind" and flexible budget, offering superior protection in all other specified areas.

Therefore, the **Elite** tier is recommended as it provides the highest level of coverage for the customer's primary concerns (medical including pre-existing conditions, cancellation, luggage, delays) and includes the required hiking cover, best matching the desire for comprehensive peace of mind despite the apparent lack of specific pet accommodation coverage across all tiers based on the provided data.
