**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers offer the necessary optional add-ons for 'Pre-existing medical conditions' and 'Pet care'. However, they differ significantly in coverage limits and specific conditions for the pre-existing medical cover.
*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits overall (e.g., $200k base medical, $7.5k cancellation). Critically, its pre-existing condition add-on for overseas medical expenses has a low limit ($50k) and imposes a 50% co-payment, which is a major drawback given the customer's specific concern.
*   **Business:** Provides substantially higher limits than Premium (e.g., $500k base medical, $10k cancellation, $5k luggage). Its pre-existing condition add-on offers $100k for overseas medical expenses and $100k for evacuation/repatriation, importantly *without* the 50% co-payment on medical expenses seen in Premium. This makes it a much stronger option.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits across all categories (e.g., $1M base medical, $15k cancellation, $7.5k luggage). Its pre-existing condition add-on provides $150k for overseas medical expenses and $150k for evacuation/repatriation, also *without* the 50% co-payment on medical expenses.

The customer emphasized comprehensive coverage for peace of mind, particularly regarding the husband's pre-existing high blood pressure, and has a flexible budget. While Business offers robust coverage, the First tier provides the highest available limits for medical expenses (both base and pre-existing), trip cancellation, and luggage. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, selecting a single tier is required. The superior limits of the First tier, especially for the critical pre-existing condition coverage ($150k vs $100k in Business, without co-pay unlike Premium), best align with the customer's stated priority for maximum peace of mind.

Therefore, the First tier is recommended as it provides the most comprehensive coverage levels available from FWD for this customer's specific needs, particularly addressing the pre-existing condition concern with the highest limit and no co-payment on medical expenses, fulfilling the desire for peace of mind with a flexible budget.

    *   Covers the crucial pre-existing condition requirement with a high limit ($150k) for overseas medical expenses *without* co-payment (unlike Premium tier).
    *   Includes the necessary optional 'Pet care' add-on to cover additional kennel fees due to delays.
    *   Covers standard hiking activities under medical/accident benefits.
    *   Offers high Travel Delay benefits ($1000 max overseas).

    *   Requires purchasing two separate optional add-ons ('Pre-existing medical conditions' and 'Pet care') at additional cost.
    *   Trip Cancellation due to a pre-existing condition (via the add-on) is subject to a 50% co-payment.
    *   Will be the most expensive premium among the three FWD tiers.
