**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a 2-week trip to Japan for two adults (26-40) needing medical, luggage, delay, cancellation cover, and hiking coverage within a $200-$300 budget per person:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it does not explicitly cover amateur sports like hiking (trekking), which is a specific customer requirement. While it's the cheapest, it fails on a key activity coverage need.
*   **Elite:** This tier offers the highest coverage limits across all categories (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation) and covers hiking. However, it is the most expensive tier and likely exceeds the customer's stated budget preference of $200-$300 per person.
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for Japan travel, offering enhanced medical limits ($500k) compared to Deluxe and includes Japan-specific cashless medical services. It covers hiking. However, its Trip Cancellation ($6k) and Luggage ($5k) limits are identical to Deluxe, and it is priced higher than Deluxe, potentially pushing or exceeding the budget.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier provides a balanced level of coverage that meets all core requirements. It offers substantial medical cover ($300k Overseas Medical, Unlimited Evacuation for under 70s), good luggage limits ($5k), standard travel delay benefits, and trip cancellation cover ($6k). Crucially, it explicitly includes "Amateur Sports Cover" which covers trekking up to 3,500m, meeting the hiking requirement. As the second cheapest option (after the unsuitable Vital tier), it is the most likely to fit within the customer's $200-$300 budget while fulfilling all specified coverage needs.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the Deluxe tier provides the best holistic fit by covering all essential requirements, including the specific hiking activity, at a price point more aligned with the customer's budget compared to the higher GO Japan! and Elite tiers. The Vital tier is excluded due to the lack of hiking coverage.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met

### Requirement: trip cancellation (check wedding reason)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Trip Cancellation or Postponement
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person', 'limit': 6000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 10000, 'basis': None}]

Includes coverage for loss of frequent flyer or similar travel points used.', 'source_location': 'Page 4, Section 13 & Page 2, Trip Cancellation'}]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: The policy covers trip cancellation up to $6,000 per person for "Insured Events". However, the specific list of Insured Events is not provided in the JSON data. Standard travel insurance policies typically do *not* cover cancellation solely due to choosing to attend a personal event like a wedding, unless it involves unforeseen circumstances like death or serious illness/injury of the traveller, a travel companion, or a close relative preventing travel. Therefore, the specific reason requested (attending a family wedding) is unlikely to be covered.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Deluxe

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Covers all core requirements: Medical Emergencies, Lost/Damaged Luggage, Travel Delays, and Trip Cancellation (for standard reasons).
    *   Explicitly covers hiking (trekking up to 3,500m) under Amateur Sports Cover.
    *   Provides strong medical coverage with $300k overseas expenses and Unlimited evacuation (for under 70s).
    *   Offers reasonable limits for luggage ($5k) and cancellation ($6k).
    *   More likely to fit within the customer's budget ($200-$300 pp) compared to GO Japan! and Elite tiers.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip Cancellation: Unlikely to cover cancellation solely for the purpose of attending a family wedding, as this typically falls outside standard "Insured Events".
    *   Coverage limits are lower than GO Japan! (for medical) and Elite (across most categories), though still substantial.
