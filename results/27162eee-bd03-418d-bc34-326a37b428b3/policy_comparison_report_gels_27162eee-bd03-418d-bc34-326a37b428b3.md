**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers: The Basic tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for "Adventurous leisure activities" (Section 37), failing to meet the customer's requirement for hiking coverage. Both the Gold and Platinum tiers cover adventurous leisure activities, including hiking. They also both provide core coverage for medical emergencies, lost luggage, travel delays, and standard trip cancellation, with Platinum offering significantly higher limits and slightly better triggers (e.g., 4 vs 6 hours for travel delay payout) than Gold.

Regarding the specific request to check trip cancellation cover for attending a family wedding, standard trip cancellation clauses typically do not cover this reason. However, both Gold and Platinum tiers include a "Travel inconvenience for any reason" benefit (Section 19), which offers a partial payout (e.g., 50% of non-refundable costs up to a limit, as per the example on Page 6) for cancellation for reasons not otherwise covered, provided the policy is purchased within 30 days of the initial travel booking. This partially addresses the customer's query, although it's not full coverage and is conditional.

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. While Platinum offers the highest coverage, the Gold tier provides substantial limits (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Trip Cancellation, $5k Baggage Loss) that are generally sufficient for a 2-week trip to Japan for young, healthy adults without pre-existing conditions. Crucially, Gold meets the hiking requirement and partially addresses the wedding cancellation query via the "any reason" benefit. Given the customer's budget preference of $200-$300 per person, the Gold tier is more likely to fit within this range compared to the Platinum tier, while still comprehensively covering the essential requirements.

Therefore, the Gold tier is recommended as it provides the necessary hiking coverage, partially addresses the specific cancellation query through its "any reason" benefit, offers robust limits for core requirements, and is expected to align better with the customer's budget preference than the Platinum tier.

*   **Policy Coverage:** Trip cancellation
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Person', 'limit': 10000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Maximum limit for family cover', 'limit': 25000, 'basis': None}]

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Standard trip cancellation (Item 16) is unlikely to cover cancellation solely for attending a wedding. The "Travel inconvenience for any reason" benefit (Item 19a) provides some coverage (up to $3000, likely 50% payout of non-refundable costs) but is conditional on purchasing the policy within 30 days of booking and may not cover the full loss.

### Requirement: Budget $200-$300

*   **Policy Coverage:** Not Applicable (Price/Budget)
    *   **Base Limits:** Not Applicable
    *   **Conditional Limits:** Not Applicable
    *   **Source Specific Details:** Not Applicable
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: While exact pricing isn't provided, the Gold tier is the mid-range option and is more likely to fall within or close to the $200-$300 per person budget compared to Platinum, while Basic is unsuitable due to lack of hiking cover.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Gold

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides coverage for hiking activities under "Adventurous leisure activities".
    *   Offers substantial coverage limits for core requirements (Medical $500k, Cancellation $10k, Luggage $5k, Delay $1.5k).
    *   Includes a "Travel inconvenience for any reason" benefit, partially addressing the wedding cancellation query (subject to limits and conditions).
    *   Likely aligns better with the customer's budget preference than the Platinum tier.
    *   No pre-existing conditions simplifies eligibility (no need for add-on).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip cancellation due to attending a family wedding is only partially covered via the "Travel inconvenience for any reason" benefit, which has payout limits (e.g., 50% of costs up to $3k) and requires purchase within 30 days of booking; standard cancellation clauses won't cover this reason.
    *   Budget alignment is assumed based on tier position; actual premium needs confirmation to ensure it fits the $200-$300 pp range.
    *   Travel delay payout trigger is 6 hours, compared to 4 hours in the Platinum tier.
