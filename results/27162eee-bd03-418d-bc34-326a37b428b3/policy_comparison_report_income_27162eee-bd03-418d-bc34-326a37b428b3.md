**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing INCOME's Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers for this customer: All tiers cover the core requirements of medical emergencies, lost/damaged luggage, travel delays, trip cancellation, and hiking activities. The primary differences lie in the coverage limits. Classic offers the lowest limits (e.g., $250k Medical Overseas, $5k Cancellation), which might be insufficient for potential high costs in Japan or significant cancellation expenses. Preferred offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Cancellation) but is the most expensive and likely exceeds the customer's budget preference ($200-$300 pp). The Deluxe tier provides a strong middle ground, offering significantly higher limits than Classic (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Cancellation) which provides better peace of mind for travel to Japan, while remaining more affordable than Preferred.

Crucially, the specific request to check cancellation coverage *due to attending a family wedding* is not a standard covered reason under any typical travel insurance policy, including all INCOME tiers reviewed. Cancellation is generally covered for specific *unforeseen* events (like serious illness, death of a relative, etc.), not for choosing to attend a planned event. This requirement is therefore considered 'Not Met' across all tiers.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. The Deluxe tier offers the best balance, meeting all core coverage needs including hiking, providing robust limits suitable for Japan, and likely aligning better with the budget preference compared to the Preferred tier. It represents a significant upgrade in protection over the Classic tier without the potentially unnecessary expense of the Preferred tier for this specific customer profile.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Not Met: Standard policy terms cover cancellation due to specified unforeseen events (e.g., serious illness, death of close relative). Cancellation *because* one wants to attend a wedding (a planned event) is not a covered reason.

### Requirement: Budget $200-$300

*   **Policy Coverage:** Not Applicable (Budget Preference)
    *   **Base Limits:** Not Applicable
    *   **Conditional Limits:** Not Applicable
    *   **Source Specific Details:** Not Applicable
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: As the mid-tier option, Deluxe is more expensive than Classic but cheaper than Preferred. While exact pricing isn't provided, it's reasonably likely to fall within or close to the upper end of the customer's preferred budget range ($200-$300 per person), offering good value for the increased coverage compared to Classic.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Deluxe

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides comprehensive coverage for all core requirements: medical emergencies (incl. unlimited evacuation for under 70s), luggage loss/damage, travel delays, and trip cancellation.
    *   Offers significantly higher coverage limits ($500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage) compared to the Classic tier, providing better protection for travel to Japan.
    *   Explicitly covers hiking under 'Adventurous Activities'.
    *   Includes COVID-19 coverage for relevant sections (medical, cancellation, etc.).
    *   Represents a good balance between coverage level and likely cost, potentially fitting within or near the customer's budget preference.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip Cancellation: Does not cover cancellation specifically for the purpose of attending a family wedding, as this is not a standard unforeseen covered peril.
    *   Budget: May potentially be at the higher end or slightly exceed the customer's preferred budget range of $200-$300 per person (though likely offers better value than Classic given the destination).
