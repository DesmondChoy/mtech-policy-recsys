**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for this customer's 10-day golf trip to Australia:

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Overseas Medical, $7.5k Cancellation, $50k Pre-existing Condition Medical via add-on). It requires purchasing optional add-ons for Pre-existing Conditions, Sports Equipment, and Car Rental Excess. This tier does not align well with the customer's expectation of "premium service and coverage" and the need for comprehensive protection, especially given the pre-existing condition.
*   **Business:** Provides significantly higher limits than Premium (e.g., $500k Overseas Medical, $10k Cancellation, $100k Pre-existing Condition Medical via add-on) and includes Car Rental Excess cover ($500). It still requires purchasing add-ons for Pre-existing Conditions and Sports Equipment. This is a strong contender.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits across all key areas (e.g., $1M Overseas Medical, $15k Cancellation, $7.5k Baggage, $150k Pre-existing Condition Medical via add-on) and includes a higher Car Rental Excess limit ($1000). Like Business, it requires purchasing add-ons for Pre-existing Conditions and Sports Equipment.

**Decision:** The customer explicitly requires coverage for a pre-existing condition (managed high blood pressure) and expects "premium service and coverage" with a flexible budget. While all tiers offer the necessary 'Pre-existing medical conditions' and 'Sports equipment protector' add-ons, the First tier provides the highest benefit limits, particularly for medical expenses ($1M base, $150k pre-existing) and emergency evacuation ($150k pre-existing), which is prudent given the age group and health condition. It also offers the highest limits for trip cancellation and baggage. Although Business offers good coverage, the significantly higher limits in the First tier better match the customer's desire for comprehensive, premium protection.

Therefore, the **First** tier, combined with the essential 'Pre-existing medical conditions' and 'Sports equipment protector' add-ons, is recommended. It provides the most robust coverage for core requirements and the pre-existing condition, aligning best with the customer's stated expectations, despite some specific golf-related requests (unused green fees, buggy damage, hole-in-one) not being covered by any FWD tier. The No Mix-and-Match rule means selecting the tier that best covers the *most important* requirements comprehensively.
