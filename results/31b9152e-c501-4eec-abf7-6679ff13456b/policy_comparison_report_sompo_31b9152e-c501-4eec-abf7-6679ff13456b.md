**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) for a 3-week European trip for two travelers (41-55) with specific needs:

1.  **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for travel to Japan and is unsuitable for the customer's European destination.
2.  **Vital:** This tier is inadequate. It explicitly excludes pre-existing condition coverage for Emergency Medical Evacuation (Section 4) and likely for general medical expenses based on standard policy terms. It also lacks explicit coverage for amateur sports like hiking (trekking), a key requirement. The overall limits are significantly lower than other tiers.
3.  **Deluxe vs. Elite:** Both tiers cover hiking (trekking up to 3,500m) and offer some coverage for pre-existing conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation (Deluxe: $100k, Elite: $150k). However, the Elite tier provides substantially higher limits across crucial areas: Medical Expenses Overseas ($1M vs $300k), Trip Cancellation ($15k vs $6k), and Baggage Loss ($8k vs $5k).

Given the customer's requirements:
*   **Pre-existing condition (high blood pressure):** Elite offers a higher sub-limit for evacuation related to pre-existing conditions ($150k vs $100k). While general medical expense coverage for pre-existing conditions remains ambiguous in the provided data for both, Elite's much higher overall medical limit ($1M) offers a greater safety net.
*   **Hiking:** Both Deluxe and Elite explicitly cover trekking up to 3,500m.
*   **Trip Cancellation (Family Emergency/Wedding):** The specific reason (attending wedding due to family emergency) is not guaranteed cover under standard "Insured Events" in *any* tier unless it involves unforeseen death/serious illness of a close relative. However, Elite's significantly higher limit ($15k vs $6k) provides much better financial protection if cancellation occurs for a *covered* reason.
*   **Flexible Budget & Proper Coverage:** The customer has a flexible budget and prioritizes "proper coverage" and avoiding claim issues. Elite's higher limits and broader coverage scope align better with this preference for comprehensive protection and value, despite the higher cost.

Therefore, considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the **Elite** tier is recommended. It provides the most comprehensive coverage addressing the key requirements, particularly the higher limits for medical, cancellation, and the slightly better stated coverage for pre-existing condition evacuation, aligning with the customer's flexible budget and desire for robust protection.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: The policy provides a cash benefit per specified delay period (e.g., $100 for the first 6 hours), intended to cover incidental expenses like meals or accommodation, rather than direct reimbursement based on receipts for these items as the customer might expect.

### Requirement: Sports and Adventure Activities (Hiking)

### Requirement: Trip Cancellation (Family emergencies related to an important event like a wedding)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Trip Cancellation or Postponement
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person', 'limit': 15000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 25000, 'basis': None}]
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: The policy provides a high limit (SGD 15,000 per person) for cancellation due to defined "Insured Events". However, the provided JSON does not list these specific events. Standard policies typically cover cancellation due to unforeseen death, serious injury, or illness of the insured, travel companion, or a close relative, or events like strikes, natural disasters, etc. Cancellation *solely* to attend a wedding due to a "family emergency" (unless that emergency meets the policy definition, e.g., sudden critical illness of the sister requiring the traveler's presence) might not be a covered reason. The customer must verify if their specific scenario falls under the defined "Insured Events" in the full policy wording.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Highest available limits for Medical Expenses Overseas (SGD 1M), Trip Cancellation (SGD 15k), and Baggage Loss (SGD 8k).
    *   Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for travelers under 70.
    *   Explicitly covers pre-existing conditions for Emergency Medical Evacuation up to SGD 150,000 (for under 70s).
    *   Explicitly covers hiking (trekking up to 3,500m) under Amateur Sports Cover.
    *   High cash benefit limit for Travel Delays (SGD 2k).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Medical Coverage for Pre-existing Conditions: Coverage under the main 'Medical Expenses Incurred Overseas' benefit for the high blood pressure is not explicitly confirmed in the provided data and needs verification in the full policy wording.
    *   Travel Delay Coverage: Provides a cash benefit per delay period, not direct reimbursement for accommodation/meals, which differs from the customer's stated expectation.
    *   Trip Cancellation Reason: Coverage for cancellation specifically due to a family emergency related to attending a wedding is uncertain and depends on the precise definition of "Insured Events" in the full policy wording.
