**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for this customer:

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits overall. While it covers the basic categories, the limits for critical areas like Medical Expenses Overseas ($200k base, $50k for pre-existing conditions with 50% co-pay via add-on) and Trip Cancellation ($7.5k base, $1k for 'Cancel for Any Reason' via add-on) are relatively low for a 3-week trip to Europe, especially considering the pre-existing condition and specific cancellation needs. The Baggage Delay limit is also minimal ($150 max).
*   **Business:** Provides a significant step up in coverage. Medical Expenses Overseas increase to $500k (base) and $100k (for pre-existing conditions via add-on, no co-pay mentioned for medical). Trip Cancellation is $10k (base) and $3k (for 'Cancel for Any Reason' via add-on, 50% reimbursement). Baggage cover ($5k) and Baggage Delay ($600 max) are also improved. This tier includes Car Rental Excess cover in the base plan.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits ($1M Medical base, $150k pre-existing via add-on; $15k Cancellation base, $6k 'Cancel for Any Reason' via add-on; $7.5k Baggage). While providing the most comprehensive cover, the incremental benefit over the Business tier comes at a higher cost.

**Reasoning for Recommendation:**

The customer requires robust coverage for several key areas: Medical (including a pre-existing condition), Trip Cancellation (specifically for a non-standard reason like a wedding emergency), Luggage, Travel Delays, and Hiking.

1.  **Pre-existing Condition:** All tiers require the purchase of the 'Pre-existing medical conditions' add-on. The Business tier's $100k limit for overseas medical expenses related to this is substantially better than Premium's $50k (with co-pay) and offers a good level of protection for Europe travel without potentially being excessive like the First tier's $150k, balancing coverage and value.
2.  **Trip Cancellation (Wedding):** Standard cancellation reasons likely won't cover this. The 'Cancel for any reason' add-on is necessary. The Business tier offers a $3,000 limit (50% reimbursement), covering up to $6,000 in non-refundable costs, which is significantly more useful than Premium's $1,000 limit and offers fair value compared to First's $6,000 limit.
3.  **Core Coverage:** Business tier provides solid base limits for Medical ($500k), standard Cancellation ($10k), and Baggage ($5k), suitable for a European trip.
4.  **Fair Value:** While the budget is flexible, the customer seeks 'fair value'. The Business tier strikes a good balance, offering significantly enhanced protection over Premium in the areas most critical to the customer (pre-existing conditions, specific cancellation needs, general medical), without the potentially higher cost of the First tier's maximum limits.

Therefore, considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the **Business** tier (assuming the necessary 'Pre-existing medical conditions' and 'Cancel for any reason' add-ons are purchased) provides the most suitable and balanced coverage ('proper coverage' at 'fair value') for this customer's specific requirements compared to the Premium and First tiers offered by FWD.

    *   Represents a strong balance of comprehensive coverage and 'fair value' compared to Premium and First tiers.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Travel Delay coverage provides a cash benefit, not direct reimbursement for accommodation/meals as requested (Partially Met).

The 'Cancel for any reason' add-on only reimburses 50% of the costs up to the limit and must be purchased within 7 days of the initial trip deposit.
