**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions (like the customer's high blood pressure) and does not cover adventurous leisure activities (like hiking). These are critical requirements for the customer.
*   **Gold:** This tier offers coverage for adventurous activities (hiking) and provides an *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions. It covers core requirements like medical ($500k), luggage ($5k), travel delay ($1.5k, $100/6hrs), and trip cancellation ($10k). However, the pre-existing condition coverage limits ($150k medical, $150k evac, $10k cancellation with 50% copay) are lower than Platinum. The 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' cancellation limit ($3k) is also relatively low for potentially covering the wedding scenario.
*   **Platinum:** This tier also covers adventurous activities (hiking) and offers the same *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions but with higher limits ($200k medical, $200k evac, $15k cancellation with 50% copay). It provides the highest overall limits for core coverage (Medical $1M, Luggage $8k, Trip Cancellation $15k). Crucially, it offers faster payouts for travel and baggage delays (triggering after 4 hours vs. 6 hours for Gold) and includes 'Sports equipment cover' ($1k), directly addressing a concern the customer mentioned regarding potential damage to hiking gear. The 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' cancellation limit ($6k) is double that of Gold, offering better (though still partial) coverage for the specific wedding cancellation concern.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. While Gold *could* meet the basic requirements with the add-on, Platinum provides significantly higher limits, faster delay benefits, specific sports equipment coverage, and better 'any reason' cancellation coverage. Considering the customer's flexible budget, emphasis on "proper coverage" for specific concerns (high blood pressure, hiking gear, wedding cancellation), and travel to Europe, the Platinum tier offers superior protection and better aligns with the desire for comprehensive coverage and peace of mind. Therefore, Platinum is recommended as the single best fit, providing better value through enhanced coverage relevant to the customer's stated needs and concerns. The pre-existing condition add-on MUST be purchased with this tier to meet that specific requirement.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Standard cancellation reasons (like death/serious illness of traveler or close family member) are covered up to $15,000. Cancellation specifically to attend a family wedding due to a related emergency might not fall under standard reasons. However, the 'Travel inconvenience for any reason' benefit could apply (up to $6,000 limit, likely 50% payout of non-refundable costs, requires purchase within 30 days of booking). Cancellation due to the traveler's own pre-existing condition is covered up to $15,000 (with 50% co-payment) if the add-on is purchased. The specific wedding scenario coverage is limited.

    *   Pre-existing condition coverage has co-payments ($100 for outpatient medical, 50% for cancellation/postponement/disruption).
