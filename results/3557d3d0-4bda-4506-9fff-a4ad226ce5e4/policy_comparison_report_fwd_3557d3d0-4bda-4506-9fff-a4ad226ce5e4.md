**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers offer an optional add-on for Pre-Existing Conditions (PEC), which is essential for this customer (high blood pressure). All tiers cover the core requirements like trip cancellation, travel delay, baggage issues, activity injuries (hiking is typically covered under standard medical/accident benefits), and accidental death (though none offer a specific *double* payout for public transport).

However, the tiers differ significantly in their coverage limits.
*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $7.5k Cancellation, $200k Medical Overseas, $50k PEC Medical add-on, $3k Baggage). The $50k PEC Medical limit may be insufficient for a 3-week trip to Europe.
*   **Business:** Provides higher limits than Premium (e.g., $10k Cancellation, $500k Medical Overseas, $100k PEC Medical add-on, $5k Baggage). This offers a good balance but the PEC Medical limit is still capped at $100k.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits across all key areas (e.g., $15k Cancellation, $1M Medical Overseas, $150k PEC Medical add-on, $7.5k Baggage, $400k Personal Accident).

Given the customer's explicit focus on **comprehensive coverage**, especially for **medical treatment (including PEC)** and **trip cancellation**, and their **flexible budget**, the **First** tier is the most suitable. It provides the highest available limits for these critical areas ($150k PEC Medical, $15k Cancellation), offering the greatest peace of mind, which aligns directly with the customer's stated priorities. While more expensive than Premium or Business, the significantly higher limits justify the cost for a customer prioritizing comprehensive protection over budget. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose the tier that best covers *all* needs, and First provides the most robust overall package.
