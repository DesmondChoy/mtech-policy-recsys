**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, and Elite tiers against the customer's requirements for a 3-week trip to Europe:

1.  **Destination:** The GO Japan! tier is specifically designed for travel to Japan and is therefore unsuitable for a trip to Europe.
2.  **Pre-existing Conditions (High Blood Pressure):** This is a critical requirement. The Vital tier explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under its Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation benefit and generally excludes them elsewhere. Both Deluxe and Elite offer coverage for Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation related to pre-existing conditions (subject to limits: $100k for Deluxe, $150k for Elite, for under 70s). Given the customer's specific concern and focus on medical coverage, Vital is unsuitable. Elite offers a higher limit than Deluxe for this crucial coverage.
3.  **Hiking Coverage:** The customer plans to hike. Vital does not explicitly include cover for amateur sports like trekking/hiking. Both Deluxe and Elite explicitly include "Amateur Sports Cover" which covers trekking up to 3,500m under Personal Accident and Medical Expenses. Vital is again unsuitable.
4.  **Comprehensive Coverage & Limits:** The customer has a flexible budget and prioritizes comprehensive coverage, especially for medical and trip cancellation. Elite consistently offers the highest limits across key areas compared to Deluxe and Vital:
    *   Medical Expenses Overseas: Elite ($1M) vs Deluxe ($300k) vs Vital ($150k).
    *   Trip Cancellation: Elite ($15k) vs Deluxe ($6k) vs Vital ($5k).
    *   Baggage Loss/Damage: Elite ($8k) vs Deluxe ($5k) vs Vital ($3k).
    *   Travel Delay Max: Elite ($2k) vs Deluxe ($1k) vs Vital ($1k).
5.  **Accidental Death on Public Transport:** While all tiers cover Accidental Death under Personal Accident (Elite: $500k, Deluxe: $250k, Vital: $150k), none of the provided policy summaries explicitly confirm the customer's specific query about a *double* payout for death occurring on public transport. Elite provides the highest base coverage amount.
6.  **No Mix-and-Match:** Since coverages cannot be combined across tiers, a single tier must meet all critical needs.

**Conclusion:** The Vital tier fails on pre-existing conditions and hiking cover. The GO Japan! tier is for the wrong destination. Between Deluxe and Elite, Elite provides significantly higher coverage limits across the board, a higher limit for the critical pre-existing condition emergency evacuation/repatriation, and explicitly covers hiking. Although the "double payout" for AD on public transport isn't confirmed, Elite offers the highest base AD limit. Therefore, the Elite tier is the single most suitable option, best aligning with the customer's need for comprehensive coverage, specific activity cover, and addressing the pre-existing condition concern more robustly than Deluxe. The Tie-Breaking Rule was not required as Elite is demonstrably superior based on the requirements.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Highest coverage limits for Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), and Baggage Loss ($8k), aligning with the customer's desire for comprehensive cover.
    *   Provides coverage for Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation related to pre-existing conditions ($150k limit for under 70s), addressing a key concern.
    *   Explicitly covers injuries related to hiking (trekking up to 3,500m) via Amateur Sports Cover.
    *   High limit for Travel Delay ($2k max).
    *   High limit for Personal Accident ($500k for under 70s).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Medical treatment for pre-existing conditions: Coverage is primarily for emergency evacuation/repatriation up to a sub-limit ($150k); non-emergency treatment related to the condition is likely excluded under the main medical benefit.
    *   Accidental death on public transport: While Accidental Death is covered at a high limit, the specific request for a *double* payout benefit for incidents on public transport is not confirmed in the provided data.
