**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers:
*   **Pre-existing Conditions:** Critically, none of the provided standard tiers (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred) explicitly cover medical treatment for pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure based on the provided policy details ("Standard plans do not cover pre-existing medical conditions" noted in Classic/Deluxe, assumed standard for Preferred). This is a major gap against a key customer requirement across all tiers.
*   **Trip Cancellation:** Limits increase significantly: Classic ($5k), Deluxe ($10k), Preferred ($15k). Preferred offers the highest limit, aligning with the customer's focus.
*   **Travel Delay:** Limits increase: Classic ($1k), Deluxe ($1.5k), Preferred ($2k). Preferred is highest.
*   **Baggage (Loss/Damage/Delay):** Limits increase across tiers, with Preferred offering the highest overall ($8k loss/damage, $2k delay).
*   **Activity Injuries (Hiking):** All tiers cover hiking (<4000m) under similar conditions. However, the associated Overseas Medical Expense limits are highest in Preferred ($1M vs $500k vs $250k for adults < 70).
*   **Accidental Death (Public Transport Double Cover):** Classic explicitly excludes this ('NA'). Deluxe offers it ($400k for adult < 70). Preferred offers it with the highest limit ($1M for adult < 70).

Given the customer's flexible budget and focus on *comprehensive coverage*, especially for medical and cancellation, the Preferred tier is the most suitable choice among the options provided, despite the significant gap regarding pre-existing conditions. It offers the highest limits for nearly all requested coverage areas (Cancellation, Medical, Baggage, Delay) and specifically includes the requested Accidental Death double cover on public transport, which the Classic tier lacks entirely and the Deluxe tier offers at a lower limit. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose the tier that best covers the *majority* of their needs comprehensively. While the pre-existing condition requirement is unmet by any standard tier here, Preferred provides the superior coverage for all other specified requirements.
