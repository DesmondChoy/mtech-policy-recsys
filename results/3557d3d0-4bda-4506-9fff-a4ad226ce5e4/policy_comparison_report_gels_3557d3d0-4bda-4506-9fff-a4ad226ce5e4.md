**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** Fails to meet several critical requirements. It explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions (a key need for the customer's husband's high blood pressure), does not offer double indemnity for accidental death on public transport, and does not cover adventurous leisure activities like hiking.
*   **Gold:** Meets the core requirements *if* the optional Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit is purchased. It covers pre-existing conditions (up to S$150k medical, S$10k cancellation with 50% co-pay), includes public transport double indemnity (up to S$500k total), covers adventurous activities like hiking, and provides standard travel delay and baggage coverage.
*   **Platinum:** Also meets all core requirements *if* the optional Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit is purchased, but offers significantly higher coverage limits and better terms than Gold. This includes higher medical (S$1M vs S$500k), pre-existing medical (S$200k vs S$150k), trip cancellation (S$15k vs S$10k), public transport double indemnity (up to S$1M total), and baggage loss (S$8k vs S$5k). Additionally, travel and baggage delay benefits trigger sooner (after 4 hours vs 6 hours).

The customer has a flexible budget and prioritizes comprehensive coverage, especially for medical treatment (including pre-existing conditions) and trip cancellation. While Gold (with the add-on) meets the basic criteria, Platinum provides substantially higher limits across these key areas, offering greater peace of mind, which the customer values highly. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (requiring selection of a single tier) and the customer's priorities, the Platinum tier offers the most comprehensive protection aligned with their needs. Therefore, Platinum is recommended over Gold, despite both technically meeting the requirements when the add-on is included.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Platinum

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides the highest available coverage limits for key areas prioritized by the customer: Medical (S$1M), Trip Cancellation (S$15k), and Accidental Death/Public Transport Double Indemnity (S$1M).
    *   Offers coverage for pre-existing conditions (high blood pressure) via the mandatory add-on, with higher limits (S$200k medical) than the Gold tier.
    *   Explicitly covers adventurous leisure activities, including hiking.
    *   Offers faster payout triggers for travel and baggage delays (4 hours vs 6 hours in lower tiers).
    *   Includes high limits for baggage loss/delay.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Requires purchase of an additional Pre-existing conditions add-on benefit to cover the husband's high blood pressure; this coverage is not automatic and incurs extra cost.
    *   Coverage related to pre-existing conditions is subject to specific sub-limits (e.g., S$200k for medical) which are lower than the main policy limits.
    *   Claims related to pre-existing conditions for trip cancellation, postponement, and disruption are subject to a 50% co-payment.
    *   Claims related to pre-existing conditions for outpatient medical treatment are subject to a S$100 co-payment per visit.
