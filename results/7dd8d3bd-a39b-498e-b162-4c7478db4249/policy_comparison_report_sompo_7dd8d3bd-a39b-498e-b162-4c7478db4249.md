**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a comprehensive two-week trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it offers the lowest limits ($150k Medical, $5k Cancellation) and, crucially, lacks explicit coverage for amateur sports like hiking, which is a specific requirement. It also excludes pre-existing conditions cover for medical evacuation.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier meets the basic requirements, including hiking cover ("trekking up to 3,500m") and moderate limits ($300k Medical, $6k Cancellation). It provides a baseline level of acceptable coverage.
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for Japan, offering higher overseas medical limits ($500k) than Deluxe and Japan-specific cashless medical services. However, other key limits like Trip Cancellation ($6k) and Luggage ($5k) are the same as Deluxe. It covers hiking.
*   **Elite:** This tier offers significantly higher limits across all major areas requested: Trip Cancellation ($15k), Medical Overseas ($1M), Lost/Damaged Luggage ($8k), and Travel Delay (max $2k). It also includes the required hiking cover ("trekking up to 3,500m").

The customer emphasized needing "comprehensive" and "proper" coverage after a previous negative experience, specifically mentioning Trip Cancellation, Medical ("the works"), Luggage, and Delays. While Deluxe and GO Japan! cover these areas, the Elite tier's substantially higher limits align best with the customer's desire for robust protection and peace of mind. Although GO Japan! has Japan-specific benefits, the Elite tier's superior overall limits provide more comprehensive protection against significant potential losses, which seems paramount to this customer.

None of the SOMPO tiers explicitly offer the requested "double payout for accidental death on public transport". Given this specific feature is unavailable across all options, the decision focuses on the best overall fit for the other core requirements. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose the single tier that best balances all needs.

Therefore, the **Elite** tier is recommended as it provides the highest level of coverage for the customer's core requirements (Cancellation, Medical, Luggage, Delays) and includes the necessary Hiking cover, best matching the request for "comprehensive" insurance.

### Requirement: Clarity on pre-existing conditions and hidden exclusions

*   **Policy Coverage:** Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation (Including Mortal Remains) Back to Singapore
    *   **Base Limits:** [... {'type': 'Per Insured Person - up to 70 years (Pre-existing Conditions)', 'limit': 150000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - above 70 years (Pre-existing Conditions)', 'limit': 75000, 'basis': None} ...]

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Provides specific coverage limits for pre-existing conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation ($150k for under 70s). However, full clarity on all hidden exclusions requires reviewing the entire policy wording document, which is standard practice. The customer has no pre-existing conditions, reducing the immediate impact, but the policy does offer some cover here unlike the Vital tier.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides the highest coverage limits for key requirements: Trip Cancellation ($15k), Medical Overseas ($1M), Lost/Damaged Luggage ($8k), Accidental Death ($500k), and Travel Delay (max $2k).
    *   Fully covers the specific requirement for Hiking ("trekking up to 3,500m").
    *   Offers Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for travellers under 70.
    *   Includes coverage for pre-existing conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation (up to $150k for under 70s).
    *   Aligns well with the customer's stated need for "comprehensive" and "proper" coverage.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Accidental Death (Double payout on public transport): Does not meet the specific request for a double payout; standard Accidental Death limit applies.
    *   Clarity on pre-existing conditions and hidden exclusions: While evacuation cover for pre-existing conditions is specified, full clarity requires reviewing the complete policy document (standard for all insurance).
