**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All tiers cover the core requirements like Trip Cancellation, Medical Expenses, Luggage Loss/Delay, Travel Delay, and Hiking (under Adventurous Activities). However, a key specific requirement from the customer is the "double payout for accidental death on public transport".

*   The **Classic** tier explicitly states "Public transport double cover for accidental death - NA", failing to meet this specific requirement.
*   The **Deluxe** tier includes "Public transport double cover for accidental death" with a limit of SGD 400,000 for an adult under 70, fulfilling this requirement. It also offers substantial limits for other key areas (SGD 10,000 Trip Cancellation, SGD 500,000 Medical Overseas).
*   The **Preferred** tier also includes the double payout feature, but with significantly higher limits (SGD 1,000,000 for adult under 70), along with higher limits across most other benefits (SGD 15,000 Trip Cancellation, SGD 1,000,000 Medical Overseas).

While the customer requested "comprehensive" coverage, they did not specify minimum monetary limits beyond requesting the *types* of coverage and the specific double payout feature. Both Deluxe and Preferred meet all stated requirements, including the crucial double payout. The Deluxe tier provides robust coverage levels that align with a "comprehensive" need without potentially over-insuring at the higher cost of the Preferred tier. Since both Deluxe and Preferred fulfill all the customer's explicit requirements, they are considered equally suitable in meeting the defined needs. Applying the Tie-Breaking Rule (select the cheapest among equally suitable options based on the ranking: Classic < Deluxe < Preferred), the **Deluxe** tier is recommended.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Deluxe

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Meets all specified coverage requirements (Trip Cancellation, Medical, Luggage Loss/Delay, Travel Delay, Hiking).
    *   Includes the specifically requested double payout for accidental death on public transport (SGD 400,000 limit for adult under 70).
    *   Provides robust coverage limits suitable for a comprehensive plan (e.g., SGD 500,000 Medical Overseas, Unlimited Evacuation for under 70s).
    *   Covers COVID-19 related medical expenses overseas and cancellation/shortening (subject to conditions).
    *   Provides clarity that standard plans exclude pre-existing conditions and outlines conditions/exclusions for adventurous activities like hiking.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   As a standard plan, it does not cover pre-existing medical conditions (this was clarified as requested, but remains a limitation if conditions existed).
    *   Coverage limits are lower than the Preferred tier; if the customer desires the absolute maximum coverage available regardless of cost, this tier might be seen as less comprehensive than Preferred.
