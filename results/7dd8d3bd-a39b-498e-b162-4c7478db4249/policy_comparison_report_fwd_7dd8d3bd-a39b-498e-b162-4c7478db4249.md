**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the customer's trip to Japan: All tiers cover the core requirements like Trip Cancellation, Medical Expenses, Baggage Loss/Delay, and Travel Delays. Standard leisure hiking is also typically covered under all FWD tiers as it's not listed as a specific exclusion for non-professional activities. However, the tiers differ significantly in their coverage limits.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $7,500 Cancellation, $200k Overseas Medical, $3,000 Baggage). While covering the basics, these limits might not align with the customer's desire for "comprehensive" coverage, especially given their previous negative experiences.
*   **Business:** Provides substantially higher limits than Premium (e.g., $10,000 Cancellation, $500k Overseas Medical, $5,000 Baggage, Unlimited Evacuation). This tier offers a robust level of protection that aligns well with the "comprehensive" requirement for a trip to a destination like Japan.
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits available (e.g., $15,000 Cancellation, $1M Overseas Medical, $7,500 Baggage, Unlimited Evacuation). While providing the maximum coverage, it comes at the highest price point and the limits may exceed what is strictly necessary for this specific trip profile (2 weeks, age 26-40, no pre-existing conditions).

The customer's specific request for a "double payout for accidental death on public transport" is **not met** by any of the FWD tiers (Premium, Business, or First); they all provide a standard lump sum under Personal Accident cover regardless of the mode of transport. Clarity on pre-existing conditions and exclusions is available in the policy wording for all tiers.

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must choose one complete tier), the Business tier strikes the best balance. It offers significantly more comprehensive coverage limits than the Premium tier, addressing the customer's need for robust protection and avoiding potential underinsurance issues experienced previously. While the First tier offers even higher limits, the Business tier's limits are already substantial and generally considered comprehensive for the specified trip, making it a more value-conscious choice while still fulfilling the core requirement for strong coverage.

Therefore, the **Business** tier is recommended as the single most suitable option, providing comprehensive limits across key areas without potentially unnecessary expense compared to the First tier.
