**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers: The Basic tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for 'Adventurous leisure activities' (which includes Hiking) and does not offer the 'Public transport double indemnity' benefit specifically requested by the customer. Both the Gold and Platinum tiers cover all the customer's core requirements: Trip Cancellation, comprehensive Medical Coverage (including emergency treatment and hospital stays), Lost/Damaged and Delayed Luggage, Travel Delays, Sports and Adventure (specifically covering Hiking via 'Adventurous leisure activities'), and the requested 'Public transport double indemnity' for accidental death.

The primary difference between Gold and Platinum lies in the coverage limits and delay triggers; Platinum offers higher monetary limits (e.g., $1M vs $500k for overseas medical, $15k vs $10k for trip cancellation) and shorter delay triggers (4 hours vs 6 hours for travel/baggage delay payouts). However, the Gold tier already provides substantial limits ($500k medical, $1M evacuation, $10k cancellation, $5k baggage loss, $250k AD&D with double indemnity up to $500k) which constitute "comprehensive" and "proper" coverage for a two-week trip to Japan, meeting all specified needs including hiking and the double indemnity request.

Since both Gold and Platinum tiers fulfill all the *types* of coverage requested by the customer, they are considered equally suitable in meeting the fundamental requirements. Applying the Tie-Breaking Rule (select the cheapest among equally suitable options), the Gold tier is recommended as it appears before Platinum in the price ranking (Basic < Gold < Platinum) while still comprehensively addressing all stated needs.

The policy explicitly states which activities are covered (Hiking via Adventurous leisure activities) and which require higher tiers or are excluded, reducing ambiguity.
