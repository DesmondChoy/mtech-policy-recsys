**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers against the customer's requirements: The Basic tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for "Adventurous leisure activities" (which includes hiking) and does not offer "Public transport double indemnity", both of which are specific customer requirements.

Both the Gold and Platinum tiers cover all the customer's stated needs: medical expenses overseas, trip cancellation, lost/delayed luggage, travel delays, medical coverage for hiking (under "Adventurous leisure activities"), and the double indemnity payout for accidental death on public transport. Gold offers substantial limits (e.g., $500k medical, $10k cancellation, $500k double indemnity), while Platinum offers higher limits (e.g., $1M medical, $15k cancellation, $1M double indemnity).

Since both Gold and Platinum tiers holistically meet all the customer's requirements, the Tie-Breaking Rule is applied. Based on the provided price ranking (Basic < Gold < Platinum), the Gold tier is the cheaper of the two suitable options.

Therefore, the Gold tier is recommended as it fully covers all specified requirements at a lower price point compared to the Platinum tier, making it the most suitable choice according to the selection rules.
