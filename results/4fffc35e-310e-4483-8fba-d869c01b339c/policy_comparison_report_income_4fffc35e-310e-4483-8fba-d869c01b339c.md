**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All tiers cover core requirements like medical expenses overseas, trip cancellation, luggage loss/delay, travel delays, and medical needs related to hiking (under Adventurous Activities cover, applicable up to 4,000m altitude with safety compliance). However, a key differentiator is the customer's specific requirement for a "double payout for accidental death on public transport".

*   The **Classic** tier explicitly states this benefit is **Not Available (NA)** under its Personal Accident coverage (Section 13). Therefore, it fails to meet a specific customer requirement and is unsuitable.
*   The **Deluxe** tier *does* include the double payout for accidental death on public transport (up to S$400,000 for an adult under 70, Section 13) and covers all other requirements with moderate limits (e.g., S$500k Medical Overseas, S$10k Cancellation).
*   The **Preferred** tier also includes the double payout feature but offers a significantly higher limit (up to S$1,000,000 for an adult under 70, Section 13). It also provides the highest limits across other key areas like Medical Expenses Overseas (S$1,000,000), Trip Cancellation (S$15,000), and Luggage Loss/Damage (S$8,000).

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. While Deluxe meets the *type* of coverage requested, the Preferred tier offers substantially higher limits, particularly for the specifically requested double payout benefit and core concerns like medical expenses and cancellation. This superior level of coverage provides greater peace of mind and better aligns with the customer's expressed worries about significant events (serious illness, accidents).

Therefore, the **Preferred** tier is recommended as it fully meets all stated requirements, including the specific double payout request, and offers the most comprehensive coverage limits among the suitable options, providing the best overall fit for the customer's needs.
