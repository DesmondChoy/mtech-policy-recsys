**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a 2-week trip to Japan:

1.  **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it does not explicitly cover amateur sports like hiking/trekking (a specific customer requirement) and has the lowest coverage limits overall. It also lacks coverage for pre-existing conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation, although the customer did not state any pre-existing conditions.
2.  **Deluxe:** This tier covers core requirements including medical expenses, trip cancellation, luggage issues, travel delays, and explicitly includes hiking/trekking up to 3,500m. However, its overseas medical limit ($300k) is lower than GO Japan!.
3.  **GO Japan!:** This tier covers all the same core requirements as Deluxe, including hiking/trekking. Crucially, it offers a higher overseas medical limit ($500k) and features Japan-specific benefits like cashless medical services at a network of clinics/hospitals and a dedicated Japan emergency hotline (EAJ). This makes it particularly well-suited for the customer's destination.
4.  **Elite:** This tier offers the highest coverage limits across all categories (e.g., $1M medical, $15k cancellation) and covers hiking. While comprehensive, these high limits may exceed the customer's stated needs and come at the highest price point.

The specific requirement for "double payout for accidental death on public transport" is **not met by any** of the available SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite).

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. GO Japan! provides a strong balance: it meets all requirements possible within the SOMPO range (including the specific hiking cover), offers robust coverage limits suitable for Japan (higher medical than Deluxe), includes valuable Japan-specific medical assistance features, and is more moderately priced than the Elite tier.

Therefore, the **GO Japan!** tier is recommended as the single most suitable option, offering comprehensive coverage tailored to the destination and specific activities, while acknowledging the universal lack of the double payout benefit across these SOMPO tiers.
