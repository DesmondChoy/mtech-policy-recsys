**Recommended Tier:** Elite

**Justification:**

The **Elite** tier of SOMPO's TravelJoy policy is recommended as the single most suitable option for this customer.

1.  **Comprehensive Core Coverage:** The Elite tier offers the highest limits for the customer's primary concerns:
    *   **Medical Expenses:** SGD 1,000,000 overseas medical coverage significantly exceeds the other tiers and aligns with the request for "extensive" coverage.
    *   **Trip Cancellation:** SGD 15,000 per person provides substantial protection against irrecoverable costs.
    *   **Luggage:** SGD 8,000 per person offers a higher overall limit for baggage and personal effects.
    *   **Travel Delay:** While the trigger is 6 hours (similar to other tiers), the maximum payout is higher (SGD 2,000 vs SGD 1,000).

2.  **Specific Golf Coverage:** This is the critical differentiator. The customer explicitly requested detailed golf-related coverage. The Elite tier is the *only* tier among the applicable options (excluding the destination-specific GO Japan!) that provides specific benefits for:
    *   Loss or Damage to Golf Equipment (SGD 1,000 limit)
    *   Hole-in-One Achievement (SGD 500 benefit)
    *   Reimbursement for Unused Green Fees (SGD 250 limit)
    *   Accidental Damage to Rented Golf Buggy (SGD 500 limit)
    The Vital and Deluxe tiers explicitly state "N.A." (Not Applicable/Not Covered) for most of these specific golf benefits, making them unsuitable despite potentially lower prices.

3.  **Holistic Fit:** Considering the customer's emphasis on both high medical limits and very specific golf activity coverage, the Elite tier provides the best holistic match. While it is the most expensive tier, the lower tiers (Vital, Deluxe) fail to meet the mandatory golf coverage requirements, rendering them inadequate for this customer's needs. The GO Japan! tier is unsuitable due to the travel destination (Thailand, not Japan). Therefore, the Elite tier is selected based on superior coverage alignment, not requiring the price tie-breaking rule.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides the highest ("extensive") limits for core requirements like Overseas Medical Expenses (SGD 1M), Trip Cancellation (SGD 15k), and Baggage (SGD 8k).
    *   Crucially, it is the *only* tier that specifically covers *all* the customer's requested golf-related items: equipment loss/damage, hole-in-one benefit, unused green fees, and damage to a rented buggy.
    *   Includes comprehensive coverage features like Unlimited Emergency Evacuation (for under 70s), high hospital allowances, and broad travel delay definitions.

*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   The specific limit for Loss or Damage to Golf Equipment is SGD 1,000. While better than other tiers, this might be insufficient if the customer's "expensive equipment" significantly exceeds this value.
    *   The limit for Unused Green Fees is relatively low at SGD 250, which may not cover the full cost depending on the golf course.
    *   As the highest tier, it will likely have the highest premium (although exact price is not provided).
