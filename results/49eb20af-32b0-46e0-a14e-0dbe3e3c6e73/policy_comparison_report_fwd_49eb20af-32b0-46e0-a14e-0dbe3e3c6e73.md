**Recommended Tier:** Business

**Justification:**

The **Business** tier from FWD is recommended as the most suitable option for this customer. Here's why:

1.  **Core Coverage Levels:** The customer emphasized needing "extensive" medical coverage and assurance on other core benefits like travel delay, trip cancellation, and luggage. The Business tier offers significantly higher limits than the Premium tier across these key areas (e.g., S$500k Overseas Medical vs S$200k, S$10k Trip Cancellation vs S$7.5k, S$5k Baggage vs S$3k). This better aligns with the customer's desire for robust protection.
2.  **Specific Golf Requirements:** This is a key area where *all* FWD tiers fall short of the customer's specific requests:
    *   **Golf Equipment:** Coverage requires purchasing the *optional* "Sports equipment protector" add-on, regardless of the chosen tier (Premium, Business, or First). This add-on has a S$2,000 limit and, crucially, *excludes* damage that occurs while the equipment is in use.
    *   **Unused Green Fees:** There is no specific benefit covering unused green fees in any tier. Reimbursement might be possible under Trip Cancellation/Cut Short/Disruption *if* the reason for not playing (e.g., covered serious illness/injury) meets the policy terms, but it's not a dedicated or guaranteed coverage.
    *   **Golf Buggy Damage:** This is not covered. Personal Liability explicitly excludes liability arising from motorised vehicles, and the included Car Rental Excess benefit in the Business tier applies only to *rental cars* from licensed operators, not golf buggies.
    *   **Hole-in-One Benefit:** This is not offered in any FWD tier.
3.  **Balancing Cost and Coverage:** Since the specific golf needs are not adequately met by *any* tier (requiring an add-on for limited equipment cover and lacking the other benefits), the decision focuses on the best fit for the core requirements. The Business tier provides a substantial upgrade in core coverage compared to Premium, addressing the "extensive" medical need more effectively. While the First tier offers even higher limits, the additional cost may not be justified given that it *still* doesn't cover the specific golf requirements any better than the Business tier (the sports add-on limit remains S$2k). Therefore, the Business tier offers the best balance of enhanced core protection and value for this customer.
4.  **Add-on Requirement:** It is crucial to note that the customer *must* purchase the optional "Sports equipment protector" add-on with the Business tier to get any coverage for their golf equipment (subject to its terms and limitations).
