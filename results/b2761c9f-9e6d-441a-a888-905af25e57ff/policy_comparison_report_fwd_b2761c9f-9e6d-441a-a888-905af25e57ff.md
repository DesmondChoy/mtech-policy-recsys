**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers:
*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits across key areas like Medical Expenses ($200k), Trip Cancellation ($7.5k), and Baggage ($3k). While the cheapest, these limits might be insufficient, especially medical cover for Japan. The optional 'Cancel for any reason' (CFAR) add-on limit is also low ($1k @ 50% reimbursement).
*   **Business:** Provides a significant step up in coverage compared to Premium, with Medical Expenses at $500k, Trip Cancellation at $10k, and Baggage at $5k. Travel Delay cover is also higher ($500 max vs $300). The optional CFAR add-on limit is more substantial ($3k @ 50% reimbursement), better addressing the customer's specific cancellation concern, although it remains an optional extra with conditions. It also includes Car Rental Excess cover ($500). This tier offers a strong balance of coverage likely within or close to the upper end of the customer's budget ($100-$200pp).
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits (Medical $1M, Cancellation $15k, Baggage $7.5k) and the highest optional CFAR limit ($6k @ 50% reimbursement). However, this level of coverage comes at the highest price point and likely exceeds the customer's stated budget.

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. The First tier is likely too expensive. The Premium tier's limits are potentially inadequate for the destination and requirements. The Business tier provides robust coverage across all requested areas (Medical, Luggage, Delay, Cancellation) with significantly higher limits than Premium, offering better peace of mind. While cancellation specifically *for* the sister's wedding requires the optional CFAR add-on purchase with its own terms and limits (50% reimbursement up to $3k), the Business tier provides a more meaningful limit for this add-on compared to Premium. Hiking is typically covered as a standard leisure activity under FWD policies unless specifically excluded (e.g., extreme versions).

Therefore, the **Business** tier is recommended as it provides the best balance of comprehensive coverage meeting the core requirements, offers a more suitable optional CFAR limit for the specific cancellation query, includes added value like car rental excess, and is more likely to align with the budget constraints than the First tier.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Standard cancellation (up to $10k) is covered for specified unforeseen reasons (like serious illness/death of sister). However, cancellation *because* the customer chooses to attend the wedding (if it's not due to an unforeseen emergency like illness) is NOT covered by the standard policy. The optional 'Cancel for any reason' add-on MUST be purchased separately (within 7 days of trip deposit) to potentially cover this, and it only reimburses 50% of costs up to $3,000.

### Requirement: Hiking Activities Coverage

*   **Policy Coverage:** General Policy Terms / Exclusions (Implicit)
    *   **Base Limits:** Not Applicable (Activity coverage is usually determined by exclusions)
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:** [The provided JSON extracts do not contain specific clauses detailing coverage or exclusion for 'hiking'. However, standard travel insurance policies typically cover leisure activities like hiking unless they fall under general exclusions for hazardous sports/activities (e.g., mountaineering requiring ropes, expeditions, professional sports). Assuming standard leisure hiking.]
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Fully Met (Based on the assumption that standard leisure hiking is covered as it's not typically listed as an excluded hazardous activity in standard policies like FWD's. Customer should verify policy wording for specific definitions if engaging in technical or high-risk hiking.)

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Business

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides a strong balance of coverage with good limits for Medical ($500k), Cancellation ($10k), and Baggage ($5k).
    *   Offers Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation.
    *   Includes Travel Delay cover up to $500 (overseas).
    *   Includes Car Rental Excess cover ($500).
    *   Offers a more substantial optional 'Cancel For Any Reason' limit ($3k @ 50%) compared to the Premium tier, partially addressing the specific wedding cancellation concern (if add-on purchased).
    *   Likely to be closer to the customer's budget than the First tier.
    *   Covers standard leisure hiking.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip Cancellation specifically *for* a sister's wedding (not due to unforeseen emergency) is not covered under the standard policy and requires purchasing the optional 'Cancel For Any Reason' add-on, which has specific purchase timing conditions (within 7 days of deposit) and only provides 50% reimbursement up to $3,000.
    *   Actual premium cost is unknown and needs confirmation against the $100-$200 per person budget.
