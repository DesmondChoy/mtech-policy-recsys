**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All three tiers provide coverage for the customer's core requirements: medical expenses (including COVID-19 overseas), lost/damaged luggage, travel delays (>6 hours), trip cancellation for unforeseen reasons, and hiking under adventurous activities cover (subject to conditions like altitude <4000m and safety compliance).

However, the tiers differ significantly in coverage limits.
*   **Classic:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $250k Medical, $5k Cancellation, $3k Luggage). While meeting basic needs and likely fitting the budget, the limits might be insufficient for significant events.
*   **Deluxe:** Provides a substantial increase in limits compared to Classic (e.g., $500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $5k Luggage, Unlimited Evacuation for under 70s). This offers a much better level of protection.
*   **Preferred:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $8k Luggage, Unlimited Evacuation for under 70s), but may potentially exceed the customer's stated budget of $100-$200 per person.

Regarding the specific request about trip cancellation due to a sister's wedding: Standard travel insurance policies, including these INCOME tiers, typically cover cancellation only for specific *unforeseen* events like serious illness, injury, or death of the insured, travel companion, or a close relative. Cancelling a trip simply *because* it clashes with a planned event like a wedding, or choosing to attend the wedding instead, is generally *not* a covered reason under any standard tier. Cancellation due to the sister's *sudden serious illness or death* might be covered if she qualifies as a 'close relative' under the policy definition, but this specific scenario should be confirmed against the full policy wording's definitions. This limitation applies across all tiers.

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. The Deluxe tier strikes the best balance. It offers significantly enhanced protection compared to the Classic tier, particularly for medical expenses and trip cancellation, providing greater peace of mind. It is more likely to fit within the customer's budget compared to the Preferred tier. Therefore, the Deluxe tier is recommended as it provides robust coverage levels for all stated requirements (within standard policy limitations for cancellation reasons) and represents the best value proposition considering the likely budget constraints.

### Requirement: trip cancellation

*   **Policy Coverage:** Cancelling your trip
