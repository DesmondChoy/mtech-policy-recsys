**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) for the customer's 10-day trip to Japan for two adults (26-40):

*   **Vital:** This is the most basic and cheapest tier. While it covers core medical, baggage, delay, and cancellation needs, its limits are the lowest (e.g., $150k Medical Overseas, $5k Cancellation). Crucially, it lacks explicit coverage for amateur sports like hiking, which is a specific customer requirement. Therefore, Vital is unsuitable.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier offers higher limits than Vital (e.g., $300k Medical Overseas, $6k Cancellation) and explicitly includes Amateur Sports Cover, covering hiking up to 3,500m. It meets all core requirements. It is the second cheapest option.
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for travel to Japan. It offers identical limits to Deluxe for Baggage ($5k), Travel Delay ($1k max), and Trip Cancellation ($6k). It also includes the same Amateur Sports Cover for hiking. However, it provides significantly higher Overseas Medical coverage ($500k vs $300k in Deluxe) and includes valuable Japan-specific benefits like a 24-hour medical assistance hotline (EAJ) and access to a cashless medical network of 740 clinics/hospitals in Japan. It is priced between Deluxe and Elite.
*   **Elite:** This is the premium tier with the highest limits across the board (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Cancellation, $8k Baggage). It covers hiking. However, it is the most expensive tier and likely exceeds the customer's budget of $100-$200 per person. The high limits may also be more than necessary for the customer's stated needs.

**Conclusion:** The customer requires coverage for medical, luggage, delays, cancellation, and specifically hiking, for a trip to Japan within a budget. Vital is excluded due to lack of hiking cover. Elite is likely too expensive and potentially excessive. The choice is between Deluxe and GO Japan!. Both cover hiking and have similar limits for non-medical benefits. However, GO Japan! offers a higher medical limit ($500k vs $300k) and, critically, Japan-specific medical assistance features (cashless network, dedicated hotline) that add significant practical value and peace of mind for the specified destination. Given the destination is Japan, these specific features make GO Japan! the most holistically suitable tier, providing a better balance of relevant coverage and features compared to Deluxe, despite being slightly more expensive. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer cannot add the Japan features to the Deluxe plan. Therefore, GO Japan! is recommended.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Standard trip cancellation for insured events (like illness, death of insured/family, travel advisory) is covered up to $6,000. However, cancellation *because* the customer wants to attend their sister's wedding is typically *not* an insured event under standard travel insurance policies. The policy covers cancellation *due to* specific unforeseen circumstances listed in the policy wording, not voluntary cancellation for personal events.

### Requirement: Check specific terms for trip cancellation due to a sister's wedding.

*   **Policy Coverage:** Trip Cancellation or Postponement
    *   **Base Limits:**
        *   Type: Per Insured Person, Limit: 6000, Basis: null
        *   Type: Per Family, Limit: 10000, Basis: null
    *   **Conditional Limits:** null
    *   **Source Specific Details:**
        *   Detail Snippet: Covers non-refundable travel expenses if trip is cancelled or postponed due to Insured Events occurring within 30 days before departure. Includes coverage for loss of frequent flyer or similar travel points used to purchase an airline ticket. Source Location: Page 4, Section 13 & Page 2, Trip Cancellation or Postponement
*   **Coverage Assessment:** Not Met: Standard travel insurance policies define specific "Insured Events" that trigger trip cancellation coverage (e.g., unforeseen death, serious injury or sickness of the insured, a travel companion, or their immediate family member; natural disaster; strike; unexpected travel advisory). Cancelling a trip *to attend* a family event like a wedding, even if the timing conflicts, is generally not considered an insured event. The customer would likely not be covered for cancellation costs in this specific scenario unless the wedding itself was cancelled due to an insured event happening to the bride/groom/immediate family.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: GO Japan!

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides robust Overseas Medical coverage ($500,000) specifically tailored for Japan with a cashless network and dedicated assistance hotline.
    *   Explicitly covers hiking (trekking up to 3,500m) under Amateur Sports Cover.
    *   Offers good coverage limits for baggage ($5,000), travel delay ($1,000 max), and standard trip cancellation ($6,000).
    *   Includes Emergency Medical Evacuation (Unlimited for under 70s) covering pre-existing conditions up to a sub-limit.
    *   Likely fits within or close to the customer's budget range ($100-$200 pp), offering better value than Elite and more relevant features than Deluxe for this specific trip.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip Cancellation: While standard cancellation is covered, the specific scenario of cancelling *to attend* a sister's wedding is explicitly identified as Not Met, as this is not a standard insured peril.
    *   Trip Cancellation Limit ($6,000) is lower than the Elite tier ($15,000), which might be a factor if prepaid costs are very high, although it meets standard requirements.
