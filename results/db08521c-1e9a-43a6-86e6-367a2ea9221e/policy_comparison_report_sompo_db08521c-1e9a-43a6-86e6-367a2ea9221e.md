**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a comprehensive golf trip to Australia reveals significant differences, particularly concerning the specific golf-related coverages requested.

*   **Vital Tier:** Lacks any specific golf coverage benefits (Hole-in-one, Unused Green Fees, Buggy Damage are explicitly N.A.) and offers the lowest overall limits for core benefits like medical and cancellation. It fails to meet the customer's key requirements.
*   **Deluxe Tier:** Provides basic cover for loss/damage to golf equipment ($500 limit) but explicitly excludes Hole-in-one, Unused Green Fees, and Buggy Damage cover (Section 36 lists these as N.A.). This tier does not meet the customer's specific golf needs.
*   **GO Japan! Tier:** While offering slightly higher medical limits than Deluxe, it shares the same critical deficiency regarding golf cover: it only covers equipment loss/damage ($500 limit) and explicitly excludes Hole-in-one, Unused Green Fees, and Buggy Damage (Section 36 N.A.). Additionally, its features are tailored for Japan, not Australia.
*   **Elite Tier:** This is the *only* tier that includes a dedicated 'Golf Cover' section (Section 36) addressing *all* the customer's specific golf requirements: Loss/damage of golf equipment ($1000), Hole-in-one benefit ($500), Unused green fees ($250), and Damage of buggy ($500). Furthermore, it offers the highest limits across core coverages like Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), and Baggage ($8k), aligning with the customer's desire for "comprehensive coverage".

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must select a single tier that covers all their needs. Only the Elite tier provides the necessary specific golf coverages alongside robust general travel protection. Therefore, despite being the most expensive option, the Elite tier is the only suitable recommendation to fully address the customer's stated requirements.
