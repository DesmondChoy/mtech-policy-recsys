**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for the customer's golf trip to Australia: All tiers cover core requirements like Medical, Trip Cancellation, Travel Delays, and Lost/Damaged Luggage, with limits increasing from Premium to First. However, none of the FWD tiers inherently include the specific golf benefits requested (Unused Green Fees, Golf Buggy Liability, Hole-in-One).

Golf Equipment coverage requires purchasing the *optional* "Sports equipment protector" add-on, which is available for all three tiers (Premium, Business, First) with the same S$2,000 limit and the significant exclusion of damage occurring *during* practice or play. Unused Green Fees, Golf Buggy Damage Liability, and Hole-in-One benefits are not offered by any FWD tier. Personal Liability excludes motorised vehicles, and the included Car Rental Excess in Business (S$500) and First (S$1,000) applies specifically to licensed rental cars, making coverage for golf buggy damage highly unlikely.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. Since all tiers fail to meet the specific golf requirements beyond partial equipment coverage (via the add-on), the decision rests on the level of core coverage provided. The customer requested "comprehensive coverage". The First tier offers the highest limits across all standard benefits (S$1M Medical Overseas, S$15k Cancellation, S$7.5k Luggage, S$1k Travel Delay) and includes the highest Car Rental Excess limit (S$1k). While still significantly flawed regarding the specific golf needs, its superior core coverage levels make it the *most suitable* option among the FWD tiers presented, aligning better with the request for comprehensive protection, despite the noted deficiencies. The Business tier offers lower limits, and the Premium tier lower still.

Therefore, the First tier is recommended because it provides the highest available limits for the core travel insurance needs, which aligns with the customer's desire for comprehensive coverage, even though it (like the other FWD tiers) does not adequately address several of the specific golf-related requirements. The customer *must* purchase the "Sports equipment protector" add-on separately to get any coverage for their golf clubs, acknowledging its limitations.
