**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers: The Basic tier is unsuitable as it completely lacks the specific 'Golfer's cover' requested by the customer (Section 32: Not covered), failing to meet requirements for Golf Equipment, Unused Green Fees, and Hole-in-One benefits.

Both the Gold and Platinum tiers cover all the core requirements (Medical, Cancellation, Delay, Luggage) and include the specific 'Golfer's cover' addressing Equipment, Green Fees, and Hole-in-One. They also cover Rental Vehicle Excess, which addresses the Golf Buggy Damage Liability concern.

However, the Platinum tier is recommended over the Gold tier for several reasons directly aligning with the customer's stated needs and concerns:
1.  **Comprehensive Coverage & Past Experience:** The customer explicitly requested "comprehensive" and "proper" coverage, emphasizing dissatisfaction with a previous "pathetic" payout for golf equipment. Platinum offers significantly higher limits across the board, including double the Golf Equipment coverage ($1000 vs Gold's $500) and higher Rental Vehicle Excess ($1500 vs Gold's $1000), better addressing the need for robust protection and mitigating past negative experiences.
2.  **Travel Delay Trigger:** The customer specifically mentioned wanting a "reasonable" delay trigger. Platinum's trigger for Travel Delay and Baggage Delay is shorter (every 4 hours) compared to Gold's (every 6 hours), better aligning with the customer's preference.
3.  **Higher Core Limits:** Platinum provides substantially higher limits for Medical Expenses ($1M vs $500k), Trip Cancellation ($15k vs $10k), and Baggage Loss ($8k vs $5k), offering a more comprehensive safety net.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose a single tier. While Gold meets the basic list of requirements, Platinum provides a superior level of coverage that more closely matches the customer's desire for comprehensive protection, addresses their specific concerns about equipment value and reasonable delays, making it the most suitable choice despite the higher price point. The Tie-Breaking rule was not needed as Platinum was deemed more suitable based on the qualitative requirements.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Platinum

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Fully covers all core travel requirements (Medical, Cancellation, Delay, Luggage) with high limits.
    *   Fully covers all specific golf-related requirements (Equipment, Green Fees, Buggy Liability via Rental Excess, Hole-in-One).
    *   Higher Golf Equipment limit ($1000) compared to Gold, addressing customer's past negative experience.
    *   Shorter delay trigger (4 hours) for Travel and Baggage delays, aligning with customer preference for "reasonable" terms.
    *   Includes coverage for adventurous activities (implying standard activities like golf are well covered).
    *   Offers the highest level of protection available from GELS, matching the request for "comprehensive" and "proper" coverage.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   While covered, the limits for Unused Green Fees ($250) and Hole-in-One ($250) are fixed and may be lower than desired for some golfers, though they meet the specified requirement type.
    *   This is the most expensive tier, although the higher cost corresponds to significantly higher and broader coverage requested by the customer.
