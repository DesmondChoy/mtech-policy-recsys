**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All tiers offer base coverage for Medical, Luggage, Travel Delay, and Trip Cancellation, and allow the purchase of add-ons for Pre-existing Conditions and Cancel for Any Reason. However, they differ significantly in coverage limits.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Medical, $7.5k Cancellation, $50k Pre-existing Medical add-on, $1k Cancel for Any Reason add-on). While the cheapest, these limits, especially for pre-existing medical conditions, might be insufficient given the customer's specific concern about asthma and potential hiking incidents.
*   **First:** Provides the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $150k Pre-existing Medical add-on, $6k Cancel for Any Reason add-on). This offers the most comprehensive protection but is the most expensive tier, potentially exceeding the customer's $200-$300 budget, especially with add-ons.
*   **Business:** Strikes a balance between Premium and First. It offers substantially higher limits than Premium (e.g., $500k Medical, $10k Cancellation, $100k Pre-existing Medical add-on, $3k Cancel for Any Reason add-on) providing more robust coverage for the customer's key concerns (asthma, medical, cancellation flexibility) than the Premium tier. While more expensive than Premium, it is cheaper than First, making it a more suitable recommendation considering both coverage adequacy and the price hierarchy.

The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose one tier. The Business tier provides a significant upgrade in protection over Premium for the specific areas of concern (pre-existing conditions, cancellation flexibility via add-on) without potentially overshooting the budget as much as the First tier might. Therefore, the Business tier is recommended as the most suitable holistic fit. The clarification needed on trip cancellation for a family wedding is addressed by the 'Cancel for any reason' add-on available with this tier, although its limitations (50% reimbursement, purchase window) must be noted.

*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**

    *   Pre-existing Condition Coverage: Requires purchasing an additional add-on, and trip disruption/cancellation benefits related to it have a 50% co-payment.
