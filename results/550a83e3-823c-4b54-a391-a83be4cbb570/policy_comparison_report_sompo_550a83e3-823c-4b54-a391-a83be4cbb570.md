**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) for the customer's trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation (Section 4) and lacks specific Amateur Sports Cover, failing two key requirements (asthma coverage, hiking coverage).
*   **Deluxe:** Offers core coverage, includes Amateur Sports Cover (hiking), and provides a $100k limit for pre-existing condition evacuation. Medical limit is $300k.
*   **GO Japan!:** Specifically designed for Japan, this tier offers a higher overseas medical limit ($500k) than Deluxe, includes the same Amateur Sports Cover (hiking), and the same $100k pre-existing condition evacuation limit. It also features Japan-specific benefits like a cashless medical network (EAJ), which is highly relevant for managing the pre-existing asthma condition if needed.
*   **Elite:** Provides the highest limits across all categories ($1M medical, $150k pre-existing evacuation, $15k cancellation) and includes Amateur Sports Cover (hiking). However, it is the most expensive tier and may exceed the customer's indicative budget.

The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer must choose one tier. GO Japan! strikes the best balance. It comprehensively covers the core requirements (Medical, Luggage, Delay, Cancellation), specifically includes hiking cover, provides a stated limit for pre-existing condition evacuation (addressing the asthma concern), and offers enhanced medical support within Japan via the EAJ network. While Elite offers higher limits, GO Japan!'s features are more tailored to the destination and specific needs, likely offering better value within the customer's budget range compared to Elite, while being superior to Deluxe due to higher medical limits and Japan-specific features.

Therefore, the **GO Japan!** tier is recommended as it provides robust coverage tailored to the destination, addresses the specific requirements for hiking and pre-existing condition evacuation, and offers Japan-specific medical assistance features, making it the most suitable holistic choice over the other SOMPO tiers for this customer.

### Requirement: Additional requests (Clarification needed on trip cancellation coverage for family wedding)

*   **Policy Coverage:** Trip Cancellation or Postponement

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Not Met: Standard travel insurance policies define "Insured Events" for cancellation (e.g., serious illness/injury/death of insured or close relative, strike, natural disaster). Cancelling due to a conflict with a family wedding is typically not a covered reason. While the policy covers cancellation for *Insured Events*, this specific reason is unlikely covered. Explicit clarification should still be sought from the insurer, but based on standard terms, it's Not Met.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: GO Japan!

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Specifically tailored for travel to Japan, including a cashless medical network (EAJ).
    *   Provides good overseas medical coverage limit ($500k).
    *   Explicitly covers hiking ("trekking up to 3,500m") under Amateur Sports Cover.
    *   Provides a stated limit ($100k for under 70s) for Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation due to pre-existing conditions (asthma).
    *   Covers all core requirements (Medical, Luggage Loss/Damage/Delay, Travel Delay, Trip Cancellation).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Pre-existing conditions (asthma): While evacuation/repatriation has a stated limit, general medical expense coverage for pre-existing conditions is subject to standard policy terms/conditions (stability etc.) not fully detailed, hence assessed as Partially Met overall.
    *   Additional requests (Clarification needed on trip cancellation coverage for family wedding): Trip cancellation due to conflict with a family wedding is highly unlikely to be covered under standard policy terms (Not Met). Customer needs to be advised of this limitation.
