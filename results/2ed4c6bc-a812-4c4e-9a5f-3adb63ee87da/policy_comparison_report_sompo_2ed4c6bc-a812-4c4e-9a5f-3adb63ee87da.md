**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a two-week trip to Japan for two adults (41-55) with a budget of $200-$300:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable. It lacks specific coverage for amateur sports like hiking and explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under the Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation benefit (Section 4), failing to meet two key customer requirements.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier covers core needs including Medical Expenses ($300k overseas), Trip Cancellation ($6k), Travel Delay, Lost Luggage ($5k), and Hiking (up to 3,500m). It also includes Emergency Medical Evacuation for pre-existing conditions up to $100k (for under 70s). It is the second cheapest option.
*   **GO Japan!:** Specifically designed for Japan, this tier offers higher overseas medical coverage ($500k) than Deluxe, includes cashless medical services in Japan (a significant convenience), covers Trip Cancellation ($6k), Travel Delay, Lost Luggage ($5k), and Hiking (up to 3,500m). Crucially, it also provides Emergency Medical Evacuation cover for pre-existing conditions up to $100k (for under 70s), addressing the high blood pressure concern for unexpected emergencies. Its price is between Deluxe and Elite.
*   **Elite:** This tier offers the highest limits overall (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $150k Pre-ex Evacuation), fully covering hiking. However, it is the most expensive tier and likely exceeds the customer's $200-$300 budget.

None of the SOMPO tiers explicitly mention the requested double payout for accidental death on public transport.

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the **GO Japan!** tier is recommended. While Elite offers higher limits, GO Japan! provides a strong balance by meeting all core requirements (Medical, Cancellation, Delay, Luggage, Hiking, Pre-existing condition evacuation cover up to $100k) with enhanced medical coverage ($500k) and Japan-specific benefits (cashless service) compared to Deluxe. This directly addresses the customer's destination and medical concerns, likely offering better value within or closer to the budget than the Elite tier. It is superior to Deluxe due to the higher medical limit and Japan-specific features, and more appropriate than Vital which fails on key requirements.
