**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All three tiers provide core coverage for Medical Emergencies, Trip Cancellation, Travel Delays, Lost/Damaged Luggage, and Hiking activities. However, a key customer requirement is the "Double payout for accidental death occurring while using public transport." The Classic tier explicitly does *not* offer this benefit ("NA"). Both the Deluxe and Preferred tiers include this double payout feature.

The choice then lies between Deluxe and Preferred. Both meet the functional requirements outlined by the customer. However, the Preferred tier offers significantly higher coverage limits across almost all key areas compared to Deluxe:
*   **Medical Expenses Overseas (Adult < 70):** $1,000,000 (Preferred) vs $500,000 (Deluxe)
*   **Trip Cancellation:** $15,000 (Preferred) vs $10,000 (Deluxe)
*   **Lost/Damaged Luggage:** $8,000 (Preferred) vs $5,000 (Deluxe)
*   **Personal Accident (Adult < 70):** $500,000 (Preferred) vs $200,000 (Deluxe)
*   **Public Transport Double Cover AD&D (Adult < 70):** $1,000,000 (Preferred) vs $400,000 (Deluxe)

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must select one complete tier), the Preferred tier provides the most comprehensive protection available among the options that satisfy all specific requests, including the crucial double payout AD&D benefit. While the customer's budget is $200-$300, and Preferred will likely be the most expensive, it offers the highest level of security based on the requirements provided.

A critical point for the customer is the pre-existing condition (High blood pressure). All standard INCOME tiers provided (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred) explicitly state they do *not* cover claims arising from pre-existing medical conditions. While general emergency medical treatment for *unrelated* issues is covered, any emergency linked to the high blood pressure would likely be excluded. This is a significant gap in all standard tiers presented.

Therefore, the **Preferred** tier is recommended as it fully meets all functional coverage requirements, including the specific double payout request, and offers the highest available limits for maximum peace of mind, despite the exclusion related to pre-existing conditions common to all these standard tiers.
