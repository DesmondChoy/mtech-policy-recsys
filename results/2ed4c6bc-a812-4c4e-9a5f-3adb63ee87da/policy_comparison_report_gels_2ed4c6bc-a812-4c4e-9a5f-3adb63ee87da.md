**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers against the customer's requirements:

*   **Basic Tier:** Fails significantly. It explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions (a critical need for the customer's high blood pressure), does not cover adventurous leisure activities like hiking, and lacks the requested public transport double indemnity benefit.
*   **Gold Tier:** Meets all core requirements *if* the optional Pre-existing Conditions add-on benefit is purchased. It covers emergency medical expenses (with the add-on covering the high blood pressure), trip cancellation, travel delays, lost/damaged luggage, includes coverage for adventurous leisure activities (hiking), and provides the public transport double indemnity. The limits ($500k medical, $10k cancellation, $5k luggage) are substantial.
*   **Platinum Tier:** Also meets all core requirements *if* the optional Pre-existing Conditions add-on benefit is purchased, offering higher limits ($1M medical, $15k cancellation, $8k luggage) and slightly better triggers for delays (4 hours vs 6 hours). It also covers hiking and public transport double indemnity.

**Selection Rationale:** Both Gold and Platinum (with the necessary add-on) fulfill all the customer's specified coverage needs. Basic is unsuitable due to major exclusions. Since both Gold and Platinum provide the required coverage (including the crucial pre-existing condition add-on availability, hiking, and public transport double indemnity), they are considered equally suitable in terms of meeting the *essential* requirements. Applying the Tie-Breaking Rule (select the cheapest among equally suitable options based on the provided price ranking: Basic < Gold < Platinum), the **Gold** tier is selected. It provides comprehensive coverage for all stated needs at a lower price point than Platinum, aligning better with the customer's budget preference while still offering robust protection. The need to purchase the Pre-existing Conditions add-on applies to both Gold and Platinum.
