**Recommended Tier:** : Gold

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** Covers core requirements like medical emergencies (S$100k overseas), trip cancellation (S$2k), lost luggage (S$2.5k), and travel delays (S$100/6hrs up to S$500 overseas). However, it explicitly **does not cover** the customer's specific requirement for 'Pet care' (additional pet accommodation costs due to travel delay).
*   **Gold:** Covers all core requirements with higher limits than Basic (Medical S$500k, Cancellation S$10k, Luggage S$5k, Delay S$100/6hrs up to S$1.5k overseas). Crucially, it **includes 'Pet care' coverage** (S$100/day up to S$500), meeting the customer's specific additional request.
*   **Platinum:** Offers the highest limits across all categories (Medical S$1M, Cancellation S$15k, Luggage S$8k, Delay S$100/4hrs up to S$2k overseas) and also includes 'Pet care' coverage (S$100/day up to S$800). It also has a shorter trigger time for travel delay payouts (4 hours vs 6 hours for Gold/Basic).

The Basic tier is unsuitable as it fails to meet the mandatory 'Pet accommodation costs' requirement. Both Gold and Platinum tiers meet all the customer's requirements, including the specific pet care need. Since the customer did not express a need for the highest possible limits and both tiers fulfill all stated requirements, the Tie-Breaking Rule applies. Gold appears before Platinum in the price ranking (Cheapest to Most Expensive: Basic, Gold, Platinum).

Therefore, the **Gold** tier is recommended as it is the most cost-effective option from GELS that holistically meets all the customer's specified requirements, including the crucial pet accommodation coverage, without requiring the higher limits (and likely higher premium) of the Platinum tier.
