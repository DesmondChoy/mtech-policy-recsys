**Recommended Tier:** : Premium

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All three tiers cover the customer's core requirements for medical emergencies, trip cancellation, lost/damaged luggage, and travel delays, albeit with varying coverage limits. Crucially, all three tiers also offer the specific 'Pet care' coverage requested by the customer as an *optional add-on* which must be purchased separately.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Medical Overseas, $7.5k Trip Cancellation, $3k Baggage, $300 Travel Delay) but includes the option to add Pet Care ($150 limit).
*   **Business:** Offers higher limits than Premium (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Trip Cancellation, $5k Baggage, $500 Travel Delay) and also includes the option to add Pet Care ($150 limit).
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Trip Cancellation, $7.5k Baggage, $1k Travel Delay) and includes the option to add Pet Care ($150 limit).

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must select one tier and purchase the Pet Care add-on if they want that coverage. Since all three tiers *can* meet the customer's requirements (core needs + optional Pet Care), they are considered equally suitable in terms of fulfilling the stated needs. The Premium tier's limits, while lower, appear sufficient for two adults (age 26-40) on a standard two-week sightseeing trip to Japan with no pre-existing conditions or high-risk activities.

Therefore, applying the Tie-Breaking Rule (selecting the cheapest among equally suitable options based on the provided price ranking: Premium < Business < First), the **Premium** tier is recommended. It fulfills all requirements, including the specific pet accommodation request via the optional add-on, at the lowest price point.

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Meets all core requirements (Medical, Cancellation, Luggage, Delay).
    *   Provides the specific requested coverage for Pet Accommodation costs via an optional add-on.
    *   Represents the most cost-effective option among the FWD tiers that can fulfill all the customer's stated requirements (when the Pet Care add-on is included).

*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Coverage limits are lower than the Business and First tiers (e.g., Medical, Cancellation, Luggage).
    *   Pet Accommodation cost coverage requires the purchase of an additional 'Pet care' optional add-on, increasing the total premium.
    *   Does not cover mobility aids under Medical Expenses (Overseas or Singapore).
