**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, and Elite tiers against the customer's requirements for a two-week trip to Japan:

*   **Vital:** Offers the lowest coverage limits for medical emergencies ($150k), trip cancellation ($5k), and luggage ($3k). It lacks specific cover for pre-existing conditions during medical evacuation and does not explicitly cover amateur sports (though only sightseeing is planned). It does not cover pet accommodation costs.
*   **Deluxe:** Provides moderate coverage (Medical $300k, Cancellation $6k, Luggage $5k) and includes limited cover for pre-existing conditions during evacuation and amateur sports. It does not cover pet accommodation costs.
*   **GO Japan!:** Specifically designed for travel to Japan, offering higher overseas medical coverage ($500k) than Deluxe, which is crucial. It includes the significant benefit of cashless medical services at numerous clinics/hospitals in Japan via the EAJ hotline, directly addressing a key potential need in the destination country. Cancellation ($6k) and Luggage ($5k) limits are the same as Deluxe. It includes limited cover for pre-existing conditions during evacuation and amateur sports. It does not cover pet accommodation costs.
*   **Elite:** Offers the highest limits across all categories (Medical $1M, Cancellation $15k, Luggage $8k) and the most comprehensive benefits, including higher limits for pre-existing condition evacuation cover. However, it is the most expensive tier and likely exceeds the needs for a standard sightseeing trip, especially since the specific pet accommodation requirement is unmet even at this level.

**Conclusion:** None of the available SOMPO tiers cover the specific requirement for "pet accommodation costs" due to travel delays. Given this universal gap, the decision focuses on the best fit for the remaining core requirements (Medical, Cancellation, Luggage, Delay) for a trip to Japan. The GO Japan! tier is recommended because it provides robust coverage for the core needs, offers a higher medical limit ($500k) than the Deluxe tier, and crucially includes Japan-specific benefits like cashless medical services, enhancing convenience and support within the destination country. While Elite offers higher limits, GO Japan! presents a more tailored and value-oriented solution for this specific trip profile, balancing coverage levels with destination-specific advantages. The No Mix-and-Match rule means the customer cannot add pet cover from elsewhere, making GO Japan! the best overall fit among the available SOMPO options despite the unmet pet requirement.
