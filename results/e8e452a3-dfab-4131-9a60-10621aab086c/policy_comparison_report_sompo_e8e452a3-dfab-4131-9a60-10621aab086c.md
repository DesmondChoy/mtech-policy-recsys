**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

The customer requires comprehensive travel insurance for a 3-week trip to Europe, with specific needs including high medical coverage considering pre-existing high blood pressure, luggage protection (loss, damage, delay), trip cancellation, travel delay, scuba diving coverage, and double indemnity for accidental death on public transport.

Comparing the available SOMPO tiers (excluding GO Japan! as it's destination-specific):
*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable. It explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing medical conditions under Emergency Medical Evacuation and likely other medical benefits. It also lacks specific coverage for Scuba Diving (Leisure Underwater Activities is Not Applicable) and does not mention double indemnity. The coverage limits are generally the lowest.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier offers decent coverage limits ($300k Medical Overseas, $6k Cancellation). It includes cover for Scuba Diving ('Leisure Underwater Activities' $250k limit) and provides *partial* coverage for pre-existing conditions ($100k limit for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions). However, based on the provided data, it does not meet the specific requirement for double indemnity on public transport.
*   **Elite:** This tier provides the highest coverage limits ($1M Medical Overseas, $15k Cancellation, $8k Baggage). It includes cover for Scuba Diving ('Leisure Underwater Activities' $350k limit) and offers a higher limit for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions ($150k) compared to Deluxe. Like Deluxe, the provided data does not confirm the specific double indemnity requirement.

**Decision:** Although neither Deluxe nor Elite explicitly confirms the double indemnity requirement based on the provided JSON snippets, Elite is the most suitable tier. The customer emphasized "comprehensive coverage", "solid medical coverage", mentioned a pre-existing condition, and stated budget was flexible. Elite offers significantly higher limits across key areas (Medical, Cancellation, Baggage, Travel Delay, Pre-existing Evacuation limit, Scuba aggregate limit) compared to Deluxe. Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, Elite provides the best overall package aligning with the customer's desire for comprehensive protection, despite the apparent gap regarding the double indemnity clause in the provided data.

Therefore, the Elite tier is recommended as it offers the highest level of coverage for the majority of the customer's requirements, particularly the high medical and cancellation limits, and specific activity cover, which aligns best with the request for comprehensive insurance.
