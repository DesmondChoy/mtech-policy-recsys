**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers: The Basic tier is immediately unsuitable as it explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions, adventurous activities like scuba diving, and the requested public transport double indemnity benefit. This fails to meet several core requirements.

Both the Gold and Platinum tiers can meet the customer's requirements, *provided the optional Pre-existing Conditions add-on benefit is purchased*. Both tiers cover adventurous leisure activities (including scuba diving) and offer public transport double indemnity.

However, the customer emphasized the need for "comprehensive" and "solid" medical coverage, particularly considering the pre-existing high blood pressure and travel to Europe. The Platinum tier offers significantly higher coverage limits compared to the Gold tier across key areas:
*   Overseas Medical Expenses: SGD 1,000,000 (Platinum) vs SGD 500,000 (Gold).
*   Pre-existing Condition Medical (with add-on): SGD 200,000 (Platinum) vs SGD 150,000 (Gold).
*   Trip Cancellation: SGD 15,000 (Platinum) vs SGD 10,000 (Gold).
*   Baggage Loss: SGD 8,000 (Platinum) vs SGD 5,000 (Gold).
*   Public Transport Double Indemnity: SGD 1,000,000 (Platinum) vs SGD 500,000 (Gold).
*   Travel/Baggage Delay Payout Trigger: Every 4 hours (Platinum) vs Every 6 hours (Gold).

Given the customer's explicit request for comprehensive coverage, the presence of a pre-existing condition, the destination, their flexible budget ("get me the right plan, not the cheapest"), and the No Mix-and-Match rule (requiring a single tier choice), the Platinum tier provides a substantially higher level of protection and better aligns with the customer's stated needs and risk profile. Therefore, Platinum is recommended over Gold.
