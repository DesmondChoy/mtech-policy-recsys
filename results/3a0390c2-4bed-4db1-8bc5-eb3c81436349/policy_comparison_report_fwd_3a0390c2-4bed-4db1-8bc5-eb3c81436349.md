**Recommended Tier:** : Premium

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers: All three tiers cover the core requirements of trip cancellation, lost/damaged luggage, medical expenses, travel delays, and implicitly cover leisure hiking as it's not listed under general exclusions. The specific requirement for pet accommodation fees due to travel delay is addressed by the 'Pet care' benefit, which is an **optional add-on** available for purchase across *all three tiers* (Premium, Business, First). It is not included as standard in any tier.

Since the core coverage types are met by all tiers, and the specific pet care requirement necessitates purchasing an optional add-on regardless of the chosen tier, all three tiers can technically fulfill the customer's list of requirements. The main difference lies in the coverage limits, with Premium offering the lowest limits (e.g., $7,500 Trip Cancellation, $200k Overseas Medical), Business offering mid-range limits (e.g., $10k Trip Cancellation, $500k Overseas Medical), and First offering the highest limits (e.g., $15k Trip Cancellation, $1M Overseas Medical).

Given that the customer did not specify a need for particularly high coverage limits and mentioned a budget consideration in the initial call (though not a strict constraint in the final requirements JSON), and all tiers meet the fundamental requirements list (with the pet care add-on), the tiers are considered equally suitable in terms of *type* of coverage provided. Applying the **Tie-Breaking Rule** (selecting the cheapest among equally suitable options based on the provided price ranking: Premium < Business < First), the **Premium** tier is recommended. It provides all necessary coverage types (once the Pet Care add-on is included) at the lowest base price point.
