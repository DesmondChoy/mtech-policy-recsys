**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) for the customer's 10-day trip to Japan for two adults requiring core coverage, hiking cover, and pet accommodation cost cover due to delays:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it lacks explicit coverage for amateur sports like hiking/trekking up to 3,500m, which is a stated activity. It also offers the lowest coverage limits overall.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier covers core requirements and explicitly includes hiking/trekking up to 3,500m. However, its overseas medical limit ($300k/person) is lower than GO Japan! and Elite. It does not offer specific pet accommodation cover, only a general travel delay cash benefit.
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically designed for travel to Japan. It covers all core requirements, explicitly includes hiking/trekking up to 3,500m, and offers a higher overseas medical limit ($500k/person) than Deluxe. Crucially, it includes Japan-specific benefits like cashless medical services at numerous facilities and a dedicated assistance hotline (EAJ). Like Deluxe and Elite, it does not have a specific benefit for pet accommodation fees but provides a Travel Delay cash benefit ($100/1st 6hrs, $65/4hrs after, max $1k) which could partially offset such costs.
*   **Elite:** This tier offers the highest limits across all categories (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $2k Travel Delay max) and covers hiking. However, it is the most expensive tier. While comprehensive, the limits may exceed the customer's essential needs, and it lacks the Japan-specific cashless medical feature of the GO Japan! plan. The pet accommodation coverage situation is the same as Deluxe and GO Japan! (partial fulfillment via Travel Delay cash benefit).

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose one tier. The **GO Japan!** tier provides the best balance. It fully meets the core coverage needs, explicitly covers the required hiking activity, and offers enhanced, destination-specific medical benefits (higher limit than Deluxe, cashless service) crucial for Japan. While it only partially meets the pet accommodation request via the general Travel Delay cash benefit (the same limitation as Deluxe and Elite), its overall suitability for this specific trip to Japan makes it superior to Deluxe. It is more tailored and offers better medical peace of mind than Deluxe, while likely being more cost-effective than the high-limit Elite tier.

Therefore, the **GO Japan!** tier is recommended as the single most suitable option, providing comprehensive coverage tailored to the destination and activities, including the necessary hiking cover and relevant Japan-specific medical features, while partially addressing the pet accommodation concern through its travel delay benefit.

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: The policy does not provide specific coverage for pet accommodation fees.
