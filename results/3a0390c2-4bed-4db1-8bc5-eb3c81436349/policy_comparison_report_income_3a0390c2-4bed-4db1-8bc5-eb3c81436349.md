**Recommended Tier:** : Deluxe

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers for the customer's trip to Japan: All three tiers cover the core requirements of Trip Cancellation, Lost/Damaged Luggage, Medical Expenses Overseas, Travel Delay, and include coverage for Hiking under their Adventurous Activities benefit. The key differentiators are the coverage limits.

*   **Classic:** Provides the lowest limits (e.g., $5,000 Trip Cancellation, $250,000 Overseas Medical for under 70s, $3,000 Luggage). While it meets the basic types of cover requested, the medical limit might be insufficient for Japan, which can have high healthcare costs.
*   **Deluxe:** Offers significantly higher limits than Classic (e.g., $10,000 Trip Cancellation, $500,000 Overseas Medical for under 70s, $5,000 Luggage). This provides a much better safety net, particularly for medical expenses, making it more suitable for the destination. It also includes unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for those under 70.
*   **Preferred:** Provides the highest limits (e.g., $15,000 Trip Cancellation, $1,000,000 Overseas Medical for under 70s, $8,000 Luggage). While comprehensive, these high limits may exceed the customer's needs unless they have specific high-value items or require maximum protection, potentially leading to unnecessary cost.

The specific request for "cover for extra pet hotel fees if return flight...is delayed" is not explicitly met as a separate reimbursable benefit by *any* of the tiers. However, all tiers provide a cash benefit under the "Travel Delay" section ($100 per 6 hours of delay for adults overseas in both Classic and Deluxe, up to the section limit), which the customer could use towards such costs, although it's not a direct reimbursement for that specific expense.

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule, the Deluxe tier offers the best balance. It addresses all the required coverage types (except the specific pet fee wording), includes hiking, and provides substantially better protection than the Classic tier, especially for medical costs in Japan, without the potentially excessive limits and cost of the Preferred tier.

Therefore, the Deluxe tier is recommended as it provides a robust level of coverage suitable for the destination and requirements, offering a significant improvement over the Classic tier's limits, particularly for medical expenses, while covering all requested insurance types and activities.
