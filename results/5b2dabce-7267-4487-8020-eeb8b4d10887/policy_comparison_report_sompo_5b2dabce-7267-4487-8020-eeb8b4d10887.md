**Recommended Tier:** : GO Japan!

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO TravelJoy tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a 10-day trip to Japan for two travelers (age 26-40):

*   **Vital:** Offers the lowest coverage limits (e.g., $150k Medical, $5k Cancellation) and crucially, does not appear to explicitly cover amateur sports like hiking, making it unsuitable for the customer's planned activity. It also excludes pre-existing conditions cover for evacuation.
*   **Deluxe:** Provides moderate coverage ($300k Medical, $6k Cancellation) and includes 'Amateur Sports Cover' which covers trekking up to 3,500m, meeting the hiking requirement. It covers the core needs like medical, luggage, delays, and cancellation due to illness.
*   **GO Japan!:** Specifically designed for travel to Japan, this tier offers higher overseas medical coverage than Deluxe ($500k vs $300k) and includes valuable Japan-specific benefits like cashless medical services at numerous clinics/hospitals via the EAJ Hotline. It also includes the same 'Amateur Sports Cover' as Deluxe, covering hiking. Cancellation limits ($6k) match Deluxe.
*   **Elite:** Offers the highest limits across the board ($1M Medical, $15k Cancellation, $8k Baggage) and covers hiking. While comprehensive, the limits might exceed the customer's needs and likely comes at a higher premium.

**Key Consideration - Wedding Cancellation:** None of the SOMPO tiers explicitly cover trip cancellation due to needing to attend a family wedding. This typically falls outside standard 'Insured Events' (like unforeseen illness, death, natural disaster, etc.) covered under Section 13 (Trip Cancellation). The customer must be informed that this specific reason for cancellation is unlikely to be covered by any tier.

**Recommendation Rationale:** The GO Japan! tier is recommended as the single most suitable option. While all tiers (except Vital) cover the core requirements including hiking, GO Japan! strikes the best balance for this specific trip. It offers significantly higher overseas medical coverage ($500k) compared to Deluxe ($300k), which is a key concern for the customer, and adds the practical benefit of cashless medical services within Japan. It meets all other stated requirements (medical, luggage, delay, cancellation for illness, hiking) adequately. Although Elite offers higher limits, GO Japan! provides robust, destination-relevant coverage that aligns well with the customer's needs without potentially over-insuring like the Elite tier might. The critical requirement of cancellation for a wedding is not met by any tier, making GO Japan!'s specific advantages for the destination the deciding factor over Deluxe and Elite.
