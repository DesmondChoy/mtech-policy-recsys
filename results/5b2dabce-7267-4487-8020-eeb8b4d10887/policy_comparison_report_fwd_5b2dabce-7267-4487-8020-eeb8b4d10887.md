**Recommended Tier:** : Business

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers for this customer: All tiers cover the core requirements like medical expenses, luggage issues, travel delays, trip cancellation due to illness, and accident coverage during activities like hiking, albeit with increasing coverage limits from Premium to Business to First.

The critical requirement differentiating the tiers is the customer's specific concern about cancelling the trip for a family wedding. Standard trip cancellation clauses across all tiers do not cover this reason. This necessitates the purchase of the optional **"Cancel for any reason" (CFAR)** add-on, which is available for all three FWD tiers.

*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest base limits and the lowest CFAR limit ($1,000 per person at 50% reimbursement). While the cheapest, this CFAR limit might be insufficient for a 10-day trip to Japan for two.
*   **Business:** Provides higher base limits than Premium (e.g., $500k Medical vs $200k, $10k Cancellation vs $7.5k) and a significantly better CFAR limit ($3,000 per person at 50% reimbursement).
*   **First:** Offers the highest base limits (e.g., $1M Medical, $15k Cancellation) and the highest CFAR limit ($6,000 per person at 50% reimbursement). However, it is the most expensive tier.

Considering the No Mix-and-Match rule (the customer must choose one complete tier plus any desired add-ons for that tier), the choice hinges on balancing the need for robust core coverage, adequate coverage for the specific wedding cancellation concern via CFAR, and potential cost sensitivity (customer is a first-time buyer).

The Business tier strikes the best balance. It offers substantial core coverage limits suitable for a trip to Japan and a reasonable CFAR limit ($3,000 @ 50%) that addresses the customer's primary specific concern more effectively than Premium, without the potentially higher cost of the First tier. The First tier's higher limits, while beneficial, might exceed the customer's needs or budget, especially given the CFAR limit in Business likely covers a significant portion of potential non-refundable costs for the wedding scenario.

Therefore, the Business tier is recommended as it provides a strong, well-rounded policy with significantly enhanced protection for the key wedding cancellation concern compared to Premium, likely at a more moderate price point than First.

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Business

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Provides robust core coverage with high limits for Medical Expenses ($500k overseas), standard Trip Cancellation ($10k), Personal Accident ($300k), and Baggage ($5k).
    *   Offers Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation.
    *   Includes the option to purchase the "Cancel for any reason" (CFAR) add-on, which is crucial for the customer's specific concern about cancelling for a wedding.
    *   The CFAR limit ($3,000 @ 50% reimbursement) under the Business tier offers a reasonable level of protection for this specific risk.
    *   Provides a good balance between comprehensive coverage and likely cost compared to the Premium and First tiers.
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Trip Cancellation (Wedding): Coverage for this specific reason requires purchasing the optional "Cancel for any reason" add-on, which incurs an additional premium and must be bought within 7 days of the initial trip deposit.
    *   Trip Cancellation (Wedding): The CFAR coverage is limited to 50% reimbursement of non-refundable costs, up to a maximum of $3,000 per person. Depending on the total non-refundable trip cost, this may not cover the full loss.
