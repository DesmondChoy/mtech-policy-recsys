**Recommended Tier:** : Preferred

**Justification:**

Comparing the INCOME Classic, Deluxe, and Preferred tiers: All tiers provide baseline coverage for the customer's core requirements, including medical expenses, luggage issues, travel delays, trip cancellation due to serious illness, and accident coverage for hiking (under specific conditions). However, they differ significantly in coverage limits.

*   **Classic:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $5k Cancellation, $250k Medical Overseas for under 70s, $3k Baggage Loss). While it covers the basics, these limits might be insufficient for significant medical events in Japan or substantial cancellation costs.
*   **Deluxe:** Provides higher limits than Classic (e.g., $10k Cancellation, $500k Medical Overseas, $5k Baggage Loss) and includes Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for those under 70. This offers a better balance.
*   **Preferred:** Offers the highest limits across all key areas (e.g., $15k Cancellation, $1M Medical Overseas, $8k Baggage Loss) and also includes Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for those under 70.

The customer expressed particular concern about medical expenses (doctor visits, hospital stays) in Japan, which can be high. The Preferred tier's $1,000,000 limit for overseas medical expenses (for travelers under 70) provides the most robust protection against this concern, significantly higher than Deluxe ($500k) and Classic ($250k). It also offers the highest limits for trip cancellation ($15,000) and luggage loss ($8,000).

Crucially, the customer's specific concern about cancelling the trip to attend a family wedding is *not explicitly covered* in the provided details for *any* of the tiers. Standard travel insurance cancellation benefits typically cover unforeseen events like serious illness, injury, death of a close relative, etc., but not usually voluntary cancellation for events like weddings. Therefore, this specific requirement is likely unmet by all available standard tiers.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must choose the tier that best fits their overall needs. Since the wedding cancellation is likely not covered by any tier, the decision focuses on the adequacy of coverage for other key requirements, especially medical expenses. The Preferred tier provides the highest level of protection for medical costs, cancellation due to illness, luggage, delays, and hiking accidents, making it the most suitable choice despite the likely gap regarding wedding cancellation.

Therefore, the Preferred tier is recommended because it offers the most comprehensive coverage and highest limits for the customer's primary concerns (medical, cancellation due to illness, luggage, hiking), providing the greatest peace of mind, even though the specific wedding cancellation scenario is likely not covered.
