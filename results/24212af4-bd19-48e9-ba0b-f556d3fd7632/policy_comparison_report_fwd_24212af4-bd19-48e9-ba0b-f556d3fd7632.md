**Recommended Tier:** : First

**Justification:**

Comparing the FWD Premium, Business, and First tiers against the customer's requirements: All tiers offer base coverage for Medical, Trip Cancellation, Luggage, and Travel Delay, and allow for optional add-ons for Pre-existing Conditions (necessary for the customer's high blood pressure) and Pet Care (for the pet accommodation requirement). Leisure skiing is generally covered under standard benefits like Medical Expenses and Personal Accident across all tiers, assuming it's not professional or competitive.

However, the tiers differ significantly in their coverage limits.
*   **Premium:** Offers the lowest limits (e.g., $200k Medical Overseas, $7.5k Cancellation, $50k Pre-existing Medical add-on).
*   **Business:** Offers mid-range limits (e.g., $500k Medical Overseas, $10k Cancellation, $100k Pre-existing Medical add-on).
*   **First:** Offers the highest limits (e.g., $1M Medical Overseas, $15k Cancellation, $150k Pre-existing Medical add-on, Unlimited base Evacuation).

The customer explicitly requested "comprehensive" and "top-tier" coverage, emphasizing the need for robust medical protection (including for a pre-existing condition) and skiing coverage without "funny business". The First tier aligns best with this requirement due to its substantially higher limits across key areas like Medical Expenses (both base and for the pre-existing condition add-on), Trip Cancellation, and Luggage. While the Travel Delay benefit across all tiers provides a fixed cash sum rather than direct reimbursement for expenses (a partial mismatch with the customer's expectation), the First tier offers the highest cash benefit limit for delays.

Given the No Mix-and-Match rule, the customer must select a single tier. The First tier, despite being the most expensive, provides the most comprehensive protection and highest limits, directly addressing the customer's stated preference for top-tier coverage and mitigating risks associated with the pre-existing condition and desired activities like skiing. Therefore, the First tier is recommended as the most suitable option.
