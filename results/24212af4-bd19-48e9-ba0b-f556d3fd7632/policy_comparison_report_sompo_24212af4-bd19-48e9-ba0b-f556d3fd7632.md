**Recommended Tier:** : Elite

**Justification:**

Comparing the SOMPO tiers (Vital, Deluxe, GO Japan!, Elite) against the customer's requirements for a comprehensive policy for Japan including skiing and consideration for high blood pressure:

*   **Vital:** This tier is unsuitable as it explicitly excludes cover for pre-existing conditions under Emergency Evacuation (Section 4) and does not appear to cover amateur sports like skiing (Page 2 Highlights & Page 5 Section 28). Its overall limits are also the lowest.
*   **Deluxe:** This tier covers skiing (Amateur Sports Cover, Page 2) and provides limited cover ($100k) for Emergency Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions (Section 4). It meets the basic requirements (except Pet Accommodation) but offers moderate limits (e.g., $300k Medical, $6k Cancellation).
*   **GO Japan!:** This tier is specifically for Japan, offering relevant benefits like a cashless medical network. It covers skiing (Amateur Sports Cover, Page 2) and provides the same limited cover ($100k) as Deluxe for Emergency Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions (Section 4). It has higher medical limits ($500k) than Deluxe but the same Trip Cancellation limit ($6k). It lacks the Pet Accommodation cover.
*   **Elite:** This tier offers the highest limits across all key areas requested: Medical ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), Luggage ($8k), and Travel Delay ($2k). It covers skiing (Amateur Sports Cover Inclusion, Page 1 & 2) and provides the highest sub-limit for Emergency Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions ($150k, Section 4).

The customer explicitly requested "comprehensive" and "top-tier medical coverage" and wants all specific requirements covered accurately. While no tier covers the Pet Accommodation requirement, the Elite tier provides the highest overall limits and the best available coverage for pre-existing condition evacuation among the options that cover skiing. Although GO Japan! is destination-specific, Elite's significantly higher limits better align with the customer's stated desire for top-tier and comprehensive protection. Therefore, adhering to the No Mix-and-Match rule, Elite is the single most suitable tier despite the Pet Accommodation gap.

### Requirement: Pre-existing Conditions

*   **Policy Coverage:** Emergency Medical Evacuation & Repatriation (Including Mortal Remains) Back to Singapore
    *   **Base Limits:** [{'type': 'Per Insured Person - up to 70 years', 'limit': 'Unlimited', 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - above 70 years', 'limit': 150000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - up to 70 years (Pre-existing Conditions)', 'limit': 150000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Insured Person - above 70 years (Pre-existing Conditions)', 'limit': 75000, 'basis': None}, {'type': 'Per Family', 'limit': 'No aggregate limit', 'basis': None}]

*   **Coverage Assessment:** Partially Met: Emergency Medical Evacuation/Repatriation specifically includes cover for pre-existing conditions up to a sub-limit ($150k for age 41-55). However, standard medical expense coverage (Section 2, 3) typically excludes treatment for pre-existing conditions unless it's an acute onset/life-threatening emergency (requires full policy wording review for confirmation).

## Summary for Recommended Tier: Elite

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Highest available limits for Medical Expenses ($1M), Trip Cancellation ($15k), Luggage ($8k), and Travel Delay ($2k), aligning with the request for "comprehensive" and "top-tier" coverage.
    *   Explicitly covers Skiing under Amateur Sports cover.
    *   Provides the highest sub-limit ($150k for under 70s) for Emergency Medical Evacuation related to pre-existing conditions among the suitable tiers.
    *   Includes Unlimited Emergency Medical Evacuation for non-pre-existing conditions (for under 70s).
*   **Weaknesses/Gaps:**
    *   Pet Accommodation Coverage: Requirement is Not Met as no specific benefit exists in this tier.
    *   Travel Delay Expense Coverage: Partially Met as it provides a cash benefit per delay duration, not direct reimbursement for expenses like hotel/meals.
    *   Pre-existing Conditions: Partially Met as only Emergency Evacuation is explicitly covered up to a sub-limit; direct medical treatment costs for the condition itself are likely excluded under standard terms.
