**Recommended Tier:** : Platinum

**Justification:**

Comparing the GELS GREAT TravelCare Basic, Gold, and Platinum tiers:
*   **Basic:** Fails to meet several key requirements. It explicitly excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure, does not cover adventurous activities like skiing, and lacks pet care coverage for accommodation costs due to delays. Therefore, it is unsuitable.
*   **Gold:** Meets the core requirements, including coverage for skiing (under Adventurous leisure activities) and pet care. Crucially, it offers an *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions (including high blood pressure) which covers medical expenses, evacuation, and trip changes, albeit with specific limits and co-payments.
*   **Platinum:** Also meets all core requirements, including skiing and pet care, and offers the same *optional add-on* for pre-existing conditions as the Gold tier, but with higher limits for these specific pre-existing condition benefits (e.g., $200k medical vs $150k, $200k evac vs $150k). Furthermore, Platinum provides significantly higher base limits across most standard coverage areas compared to Gold (e.g., $1M vs $500k for overseas medical, $15k vs $10k for trip cancellation, $8k vs $5k for baggage loss, $800 vs $500 for pet care). It also features a better travel delay trigger (payout after 4 hours vs 6 hours for Gold) and includes specific Sports Equipment Cover ($1000 limit) relevant to skiing, which Gold lacks.

Given the customer's explicit request for "comprehensive" and "top-tier" coverage, and the need to cover multiple specific items including a pre-existing condition and skiing, the Platinum tier is the most suitable choice. Although both Gold and Platinum require the purchase of the pre-existing condition add-on to fully meet the requirements (addressing the No Mix-and-Match rule, as the add-on is part of the chosen tier), Platinum's superior limits, better travel delay terms, and inclusion of sports equipment cover align best with the customer's stated preference for the highest level of protection. The higher limits directly address the "comprehensive" need, making it a better fit than Gold.
