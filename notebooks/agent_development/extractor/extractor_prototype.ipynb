      "Customer Service Agent: Good morning, thank you for calling ISS Insurance, this is Sarah, how may I assist you today?\n",
      "Customer: Good morning Sarah, ah, yes, hello. I’m calling to ask about your travel insurance. Thinking of going on a trip, you see, and want to be sure I get a good deal, you know? Travel insurance can be quite pricey these days.\n",
      "Customer Service Agent: Certainly, I understand. We can definitely help you with information on our travel insurance plans. To start, could you tell me a bit about your travel plans? Where are you planning to travel to?\n",
      "Customer: Okay, yes. Planning a trip to Thailand, Bangkok and Phuket, for about… hmm, let me check… about ten days. From the 15th of November to the 25th of November this year. Hopefully flights don't get too expensive also, everything is going up, you know?\n",
      "Customer Service Agent: Thank you for that information. And who will be travelling? Will it just be yourself, or are there others joining you?\n",
      "Customer: Just myself and my wife. Just the two of us. Are there any discounts for couples, by the way? Some places offer that, right?\n",
      "Customer Service Agent: I understand you're looking for the best possible value. Let me just gather all the necessary details first, and then we can see what options are available. Could you please also let me know your ages?\n",
      "Customer: Ah, yes, of course. I am 45, and my wife is… she just turned 42 last month. So, 45 and 42. Not too old yet, hopefully still young enough for good rates, right? I saw some insurers charge more for older people.\n",
      "Customer Service Agent: Thank you for that information. And are you both Singaporean citizens or residents?\n",
      "Customer: Yes, yes, both Singaporean, born and bred! Why? Does that make a difference to the price?\n",
      "Customer Service Agent: It helps us determine the appropriate coverage and ensure we are providing the correct policy details for you. Lastly, could you tell me what kind of coverage you are looking for? Are you interested in basic coverage, or something more comprehensive? I mean, there’s always different levels, right? Like the ‘premium’ ones, but those are usually quite expensive.\n",
      "Customer: Yes, exactly! Don’t want to pay for all the bells and whistles if I don't need them. Just something… sufficient. You know, for medical emergencies, maybe some lost luggage coverage. Nothing too fancy, but definitely need medical, especially in a foreign country. Just the standard stuff, really, but at the best possible price, of course. I’ve been looking at a few other insurers online, and some are quite competitive, so you need to give me a good reason to choose ISS, ah?\n",
      "Customer Service Agent: I understand. Just to confirm, you are a 45-year-old male and your wife is a 42-year-old female, both Singaporean citizens, travelling to Thailand, specifically Bangkok and Phuket, from the 15th of November to the 25th of November, for ten days. You are interested in travel insurance that includes medical emergency coverage and some lost luggage coverage, and you are looking for the most value-for-money option. Is that correct?\n",
      "Customer: Yes, yes, that’s all correct. And just to be clear, no senior citizens in our group, just the two of us. So, you will be able to give me a good price based on this, right? Or at least tell me what kind of plans you have that fit this, and then I can compare?\n",
      "Customer Service Agent: Yes, I have accurately noted all your requirements. We will now use this information to prepare some options for you. Is there anything else you would like to add regarding your requirements at this stage?\n",
      "Customer: Hmm, no, I think that covers everything for now. Just keen to see what kind of deals you have.\n",
      "Customer Service Agent: Alright. Thank you for providing all the necessary information. We have captured your requirements and will proceed with the next steps internally. Someone from our team will be in touch with you soon to discuss the available plans and provide you with further details.\n",
      "Customer: Okay, good, good. Please make sure they give me the best possible quote, ah? I’m really looking for the best deal. Thanks, Sarah.\n",
      "Customer Service Agent: Certainly, we will do our best to assist you. Thank you for calling ISS Insurance, have a good day.\n",
