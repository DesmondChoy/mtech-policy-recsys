## 6. Our rights

If within 12 months from the date of you claiming that we are legally responsible for a claim and you do not take up the offer of arbitration, we will assume you have abandoned the claim.

## 8. Time limit for taking legal action

If you do not begin legal action within 12 months after the arbitration award is made, we will not be legally responsible for the claim.

## 9. False or exaggerated claims

If you or anyone acting for you makes a claim under this policy knowing the claim to be dishonest or exaggerated in any way, we will not pay the claim and all cover under this policy will end immediately. We can tell the police about this.
