My name is Sarah. How may I assist you today?\nCustomer: Good morning, Sarah. I'm calling to get the necessary details for a travel insurance quotation. I have some specific requirements based on my research of your policy options.\nCustomer Service Agent: Certainly. I can help you with that. I'll just need to gather some information about your trip and coverage needs. Could you please tell me where you'll be travelling to?\nCustomer: We're planning a trip to Japan.\nCustomer Service Agent: Japan, noted. And when will you be travelling from Singapore?\nCustomer: Our trip starts in Singapore, correct. We'll be away for 2 weeks.\nCustomer Service Agent: Alright, 2 weeks in Japan, originating from Singapore. And how many people will be travelling?\nCustomer: There will be 2 of us travelling. Both adults.\nCustomer Service Agent: Two adults. May I know the general age group of the travellers?\nCustomer: The travelers are in the 41-55 age group.\nCustomer Service Agent: Okay, 41 to 55. Are there any particular activities you plan to participate in during your trip to Japan?\nCustomer: Yes, we plan to do some Skiing. So, I need to ensure that the policy includes coverage for sports and adventure activities, specifically addressing potential injuries during skiing and any related emergency assistance.\nCustomer Service Agent: Understood, coverage required for skiing participation. Regarding health, do any travellers have pre-existing medical conditions we should be aware of?\nCustomer: One traveler has high blood pressure, which is stable and managed. I need to ensure the medical coverage specified in the policy document adequately covers emergency medical treatment, potential hospital stays, and related expenses, acknowledging this condition might be subject to specific terms.\nCustomer Service Agent: Noted, pre-existing condition of high blood pressure, and the need for comprehensive emergency medical coverage details. Will you be travelling with any special medical equipment?\nCustomer: No, no special medical equipment needed.\nCustomer Service Agent: Thank you. Now, thinking about potential disruptions, what are your expectations regarding trip cancellation coverage?\nCustomer: I require robust trip cancellation protection. This should cover irrecoverable costs due to unforeseen events like serious illness or injury preventing travel, or emergencies involving close family members, as outlined in typical comprehensive policies.\nCustomer Service Agent: Okay, comprehensive trip cancellation cover for specified unforeseen events. What about potential delays during the journey itself?\nCustomer: Yes, given the destination and time of year, travel delay coverage is important. I'm looking for clear terms on the minimum delay duration required to trigger the benefit, and coverage for consequential expenses like meals and necessary accommodation.\nCustomer Service Agent: Noted, requirement for travel delay benefits covering additional expenses after a specified delay period. And regarding personal belongings?\nCustomer: Standard coverage for lost, damaged, or delayed baggage is necessary. I'd be interested in the specific sub-limits for valuables and the process for claiming essential purchases if luggage is delayed beyond the stipulated timeframe.\nCustomer Service Agent: Understood, coverage required for lost, damaged, or delayed baggage, noting interest in sub-limits and delay clauses. Is there anything else specific you require?\nCustomer: Yes, one more point. I've reviewed some policy benefits summaries and comparisons. I want to specifically confirm and require a provision for double indemnity payout under the Accidental Death benefit if the incident occurs while the insured person is travelling as a fare-paying passenger on public transport â€“ like a bus, train, or ferry during the trip.\nCustomer Service Agent: Okay, I've noted that specific requirement for double payout on Accidental Death if occurring on public transport. And do you have a specific budget in mind for this insurance policy?\nCustomer: Our budget for insurance is flexible. The priority is ensuring all these specific coverage points are adequately met.\nCustomer Service Agent: Understood, budget is flexible based on coverage adequacy. Thank you. Let me quickly summarize the requirements I've noted for the two travellers, aged 41-55, travelling from Singapore to Japan for 2 weeks. You require: Comprehensive Medical Coverage with notation of pre-existing high blood pressure; Trip Cancellation cover for unforeseen events; Travel Delay benefits; Lost/Damaged/Delayed Luggage cover; specific Sports and Adventure cover for Skiing; and confirmation of a double indemnity provision for Accidental Death occurring on public transport. Is that correct?\nCustomer: Yes, that accurately summarizes all the key requirements I need included or confirmed for the quotation.\nCustomer Service Agent: Excellent. Thank you for providing those details clearly. I have recorded all these requirements. We will use this information to prepare the appropriate options for you. Someone from our quotations team will reach out shortly.\nCustomer: Thank you for your efficient assistance, Sarah. I look forward to hearing from them.\nCustomer Service Agent: You're welcome.
