My name is Sarah. How can I assist you today?\nCustomer: Finally, someone answered! I need to get travel insurance, but frankly, after my last experience with insurance companies, I'm expecting this to be another problem. Let's just get this over with.\nCustomer Service Agent: I understand your frustration, sir. I'm here to help gather the details needed to find the right coverage options for you. Could you please tell me where you'll be travelling to?\nCustomer: We're planning a trip to Thailand. From Singapore, of course.\nCustomer Service Agent: Alright, Thailand. And how long will you be away for?\nCustomer: It will be a 10 days trip. Barely enough time, probably something will go wrong anyway.\nCustomer Service Agent: Okay, noted 10 days. And how many people will be travelling?\nCustomer: There will be 2 of us traveling. We're mostly around 26-40 years old.\nCustomer Service Agent: Two travelers, 26-40 age group, noted. To understand your needs better, are there any specific health considerations I should be aware of? For example, any pre-existing conditions for either traveler?\nCustomer: Yes, one traveler has asthma. And I expect full coverage if there's an emergency because of it. Don't try telling me later it's not covered, you hear? Proper medical coverage is non-negotiable. Getting sick overseas is a nightmare I don't want to repeat.\nCustomer Service Agent: Okay, I've noted the requirement for medical coverage, and I'll ensure the pre-existing condition of asthma is recorded for consideration in the policy options. Will you be bringing any special medical equipment, like a CPAP machine or wheelchair?\nCustomer: No, no special medical equipment needed.\nCustomer Service Agent: Thank you. And regarding your activities, are you planning anything adventurous during your trip to Thailand?\nCustomer: Yes, we plan to do White Water Rafting. And I want to be absolutely sure that if something happens during *that*, we are covered. No excuses about it being too risky later on. So, sports and adventure coverage is a must.\nCustomer Service Agent: Understood, coverage required for White Water Rafting. Noted as Sports and Adventure Activities. Now, sometimes trips don't go as planned. Have you thought about what happens if you need to cancel before you even leave?\nCustomer: Exactly! What if one of us gets sick just before, or some other emergency happens? I'm not throwing my money away. We need proper trip cancellation cover that actually pays out for legitimate reasons, not just finds loopholes.\nCustomer Service Agent: Okay, so cover for trip cancellation is important. What about potential issues during travel, like flight delays?\nCustomer: Don't even get me started on delays! Flights are always messed up. If we get stuck somewhere because the airline delays us for hours, I expect the insurance to cover the extra hotel night and meals. So, yes, travel delay coverage is essential. Don't want to be stranded.\nCustomer Service Agent: Noted, coverage for significant travel delays. And how about your belongings?\nCustomer: My luggage! Yes. If the airline loses my bag again, or if it arrives smashed up, I expect to be compensated properly and quickly. Not months later with endless forms. So, coverage for lost or damaged luggage is definitely needed.\nCustomer Service Agent: Alright, cover for lost, damaged, or delayed luggage. Thank you. Is there anything else specific you are looking for in the policy?\nCustomer: Yes, one more thing. I read somewhere about policies offering extra payout, like double, if you die in an accident while on public transport â€“ you know, a bus, train, ferry, something like that overseas. Does ISS offer this? I want to know if the policy provides extra coverage if an accident happens while I'm on a bus or train. I specifically want this included.\nCustomer Service Agent: Okay, thank you for clarifying. I've noted your requirement for a policy that includes a provision for double payout for accidental death specifically occurring while travelling as a fare-paying passenger on public transport. Finally, do you have a particular budget in mind for the insurance premium for the two of you?\nCustomer: We're hoping to spend $200-$300 for the policy, but it better cover everything I've mentioned properly for that price. No hidden charges or weak coverage.\nCustomer Service Agent: Understood. So, just to confirm the requirements you've highlighted for your 10-day trip to Thailand for two travelers, aged 26-40, travelling from Singapore: You need Medical Coverage, including consideration for asthma; Trip Cancellation cover; Travel Delay protection; Lost/Damaged Luggage cover; specific Sports and Adventure cover for White Water Rafting; and a provision for double payout for accidental death on public transport. The budget is around $200-$300. Have I captured everything correctly?\nCustomer: Yes, that seems to be it. Make sure those details are passed on accurately. I don't want any mistakes.\nCustomer Service Agent: Absolutely. I have recorded all these requirements. We will use this information to identify the suitable policy options from ISS Insurance that meet your specified needs. Thank you for providing these details.\nCustomer: Right. Fine. Just make sure it's done properly. Goodbye.\n",
