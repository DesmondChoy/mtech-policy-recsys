    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Oh, hello? Sarah? Yes, hi. I... I need to ask about travel insurance. I'm planning a trip and it's... it's all a bit much, honestly. So many things to think about, I don't know where to start. I'm already feeling quite stressed."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "I understand travelling can feel overwhelming, don't worry. I can help you figure out what details we need. Take a deep breath, we'll go through it step by step. Could you start by telling me where you'll be travelling from?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Yes, yes, okay. Deep breath. We're based in Singapore, so traveling from Singapore."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, noted. And where are you planning to travel to?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "We're planning a trip to Japan. It's supposed to be relaxing but planning is just... argh."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Japan is a popular choice. And how long will you be away for?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "It will be a 2 weeks trip. Just... feels like so much could go wrong in two weeks, you know? What if something happens before we even go? Like, if one of us gets sick or there's a family emergency? We'd lose all the money we paid... it's terrifying."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, so you're concerned about the possibility of having to cancel the trip beforehand due to unforeseen circumstances like illness or family emergencies and losing your deposits?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Exactly! Yes, that's a big worry. Cancellation coverage is definitely something... something I need to understand."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Understood. And how many people will be travelling?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "There will be 2 of us traveling. Just my partner and I."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Alright. And roughly, what age group do the travellers fall into?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "We're mostly around 26-40 years old."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Got it. Now, thinking about the trip itself, are there any specific health concerns or conditions we should be aware of? Perhaps any pre-existing conditions?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Well, I have asthma. It's managed, but you know, different environment... different air... Do we need to declare asthma? It just adds another layer of worry, getting sick so far from home. What if I have an attack? Need a doctor? Or end up in hospital? The cost... oh god."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, noted about the asthma and your concern regarding potential medical expenses overseas, like doctor visits or hospital stays. We'll factor that in. Are there any specific medical equipment you need to bring, like a wheelchair or CPAP machine?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Oh, no, no. Thankfully no special medical equipment needed. Just my inhaler."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Understood. How about your luggage? Any specific concerns there?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Luggage? Oh, don't get me started. Last time we flew, the airline lost my bag for three days! It was a nightmare. I had nothing. So yes, definitely need something for lost luggage... or if it gets damaged or delayed again. It's just so stressful when your things go missing."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Alright, so coverage for lost, damaged, or delayed baggage is important for you, including reimbursement for essentials if it's delayed. Noted. What about travel disruptions during the trip?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Like what? You mean... flights being delayed? Oh yes, definitely. Getting stuck somewhere, needing extra hotel nights, food... the cost adds up so fast. That's incredibly stressful thinking about that possibility. So cover for travel delays is important too."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, cover for additional expenses due to significant travel delays. And will you be participating in any specific sports or adventure activities during your trip to Japan?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Oh, umm... we were thinking of doing some hiking. Nothing too extreme, just some trails. But what if someone twists an ankle or something? Does that count? We need coverage for hiking, I suppose. It feels risky just thinking about it now..."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Understood, coverage for injuries related to participation in hiking. Thank you for clarifying. Do you have a budget in mind for the insurance premium?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Budget... hmm. We're hoping to spend around $400 for the insurance for both of us, if possible. But peace of mind is key."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, noted the budget preference. Is there anything else specific you're looking for or concerned about?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Yes, actually. I was reading something... I want to know if the policy provides extra coverage if an accident happens while I'm on a bus or train? Like, a really serious accident, god forbid. Does the payout double for accidental death if it occurs while traveling on public transport? It sounds morbid, but these things... they worry me."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, thank you for bringing that up. You're specifically asking about a feature that provides a double payout for accidental death if it happens while using public transportation like buses or trains. I've noted that requirement."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Alright, let me just quickly recap the requirements you've mentioned to ensure I've captured everything correctly. You're travelling from Singapore to Japan for 2 weeks, there are two travellers aged 26-40. You require coverage for: Trip Cancellation, potential Medical Expenses overseas (noting pre-existing asthma), Lost/Damaged/Delayed Luggage, significant Travel Delays, injuries related to Hiking activities, and you specifically want the policy to include a Double Payout for Accidental Death occurring on Public Transport. Your budget is around $400. Does that sound correct?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Yes... yes, I think that's everything. Hearing it listed out makes it slightly less... chaotic in my head. Hiking, luggage, delays, medical, cancellation... and the public transport thing. Yes, that's it. Thank you for being patient."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "You're most welcome. I'm glad I could help clarify things. I have gathered all the necessary details regarding your requirements now. The next step would be for our sales team to use this information to find suitable policy options for you. Would you like me to arrange for them to contact you?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Oh, okay. Yes please. That would be good. Thank you, Sarah."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "You're welcome. Thank you for calling ISS Insurance. Have a good day."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "You too. Bye."
