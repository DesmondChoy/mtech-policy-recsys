    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Hi Sarah, I need travel insurance. I'm really short on time, so can we make this quick?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Certainly. I can help you with that. I just need to gather some details about your trip to understand your requirements. Could you please tell me where you'll be travelling from?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Singapore. We're based in Singapore."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Noted, thank you. And where is your travel destination?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Japan."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Alright. And how long will you be away for?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "It's a 10 day trip. Look, can we speed this up? I have a meeting soon."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Understood. How many people will be travelling, including yourself?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Two of us."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Thank you. And could you let me know the age group of the travellers?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "We're mostly around 41-55 years old."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay. Are there any particular activities you plan to do during your trip to Japan? This helps us understand the type of coverage you might need."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Yes, thatâ€™s the main point. We're going primarily for golf. So I need specific cover for that. My golf clubs need to be covered if they get lost or damaged. Also, what if I get sick and can't use the pre-booked green fees? Need reimbursement for unused green fees. And if I accidentally damage the golf buggy? Need coverage for that too. Oh, and is there any special benefit if I hit a hole-in-one? Heard some policies offer that."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, thank you for sharing that. So, noted specific requirements for golf cover: protection for golf equipment against loss or damage, reimbursement for unused green fees due to unforeseen circumstances like illness, coverage for accidental damage to a rented golf buggy, and a benefit for achieving a hole-in-one. Have I captured that correctly?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Yes, yes, exactly. That golf stuff is crucial. Now, what about the standard things? Quickly."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Certainly. Just to ensure we cover all bases, besides the golf, are there any other concerns? For example, regarding health or potential disruptions?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Of course, the usual worries. What if one of us falls sick or has an accident over there? Need cover for emergency medical treatment, like hospital stays or doctor visits. That's essential."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, noted the need for Medical Coverage including emergency treatment and hospitalisation."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "And trip cancellation! What if something happens just before we leave, like a serious illness or injury, and we have to cancel the whole thing? Need cover for that."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Understood. Requirement for Trip Cancellation cover due to reasons like unforeseen illness or injury."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "What about flights being delayed? If we get stuck somewhere because of a major delay, we need cover for extra hotel nights and meals, right? Missed connections too."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Yes, noted. Coverage for additional expenses due to significant Travel Delays."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "And luggage! Apart from the golf clubs, what about our normal bags getting lost or damaged by the airline? Need reimbursement for that."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, cover for Lost or Damaged Luggage, including reimbursement for essentials if it's delayed. Noted."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Just a couple more quick clarifications. Are there any pre-existing medical conditions we should be aware of for either traveller?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "No, no pre-existing conditions."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "And are you travelling with any special medical equipment?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "No special equipment."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Alright, thank you. So just to quickly summarize the requirements you've mentioned: Standard coverage including Medical expenses, Trip Cancellation, Travel Delays, and Lost/Damaged Luggage. And specifically for your golf trip: coverage for golf equipment, reimbursement for unused green fees, cover for accidental damage to a golf buggy, and a hole-in-one benefit. Is that all correct?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Yes, that sounds right. That covers everything. So what's next? Can I get a quote now?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Thank you for confirming. I have noted down all your requirements. The next step is for our team to identify the policy options that best match these needs. We will get back to you shortly with the relevant information."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Okay, fine. Just make it fast, please. Thanks."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "We will prioritise this. Thank you for calling ISS Insurance. Have a good day."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "You too. Bye."
