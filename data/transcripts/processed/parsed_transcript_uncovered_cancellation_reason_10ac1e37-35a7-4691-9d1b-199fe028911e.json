        "dialogue": "Good morning, thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd. My name is Priya. How may I help you today?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Oh, hello Priya. Yes, um, I need insurance? For travel? My friend said I need it, but I'm honestly a bit lost. I don't really understand this stuff."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "No worries at all, I can certainly help gather the details needed. Many people find insurance confusing at first. To start, could you tell me a bit about your trip? Where will you be traveling from?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "We'll be traveling from Singapore. That's where we live."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, traveling from Singapore. And where are you planning to go?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "We're planning a trip to Japan."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Japan, lovely! And how long will you be away for?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "It will be a 2 weeks trip."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Alright, two weeks in Japan. And how many people will be traveling?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "There will be 2 of us traveling. Just my partner and me."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Got it, two travelers. Could you let me know which age group the travelers fall into? For example, 18-25, 26-40, 41-55?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "We're mostly around 26-40 years old."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, 26-40. And do you have any specific activities planned during your trip? Anything adventurous?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Um, well, we plan to do hiking during our trip. Is that... special? Do I need something for that? What if one of us falls or something?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, noted hiking. So you'd want to understand what happens if medical attention is needed related to activities like that. Thank you for highlighting that. And generally speaking, what about just getting sick overseas? Or needing to see a doctor? Is that something you're concerned about?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Oh yes! Definitely. What if we get food poisoning or... I don't know, need medicine? That sounds important. Sorry, maybe that's obvious."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Not obvious at all, it's a very common concern. So, coverage for general medical needs during the trip is important for you. Are there any specific medical needs, like bringing along equipment like a wheelchair or insulin pump?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "No special medical equipment needed."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay. And do either of the travellers have any pre-existing medical conditions, like asthma or diabetes, that we should be aware of?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "No, no pre-existing conditions."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Understood. Thinking about the travel itself, what other worries do you have? For instance, about your belongings?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Belongings? Oh... like luggage? What if the airline loses our bags? Or if my suitcase gets broken? That would be terrible. Does insurance cover that?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, so you're looking for information regarding coverage if your luggage is lost or damaged by the airline or during the trip."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Yes, exactly! And what about the flight itself? Last time I flew, the plane was stuck for hours. It was so frustrating. Does insurance help if our travel gets really badly delayed? Like, if we need a hotel overnight?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Right, so you're interested in coverage for significant travel delays and the expenses that might arise from that, like accommodation or meals."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Yes, that sounds right. Itâ€™s all so complicated. Okay, this might sound silly... but what if I have to cancel? Like, totally cancel before I even go? What happens then? Do I lose all my money?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "That's not a silly question at all, it's a major reason people consider travel insurance. So, understanding the coverage for trip cancellation is a key requirement for you."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Yes, it is. Actually, I need to know if I'm covered if I have to cancel my trip for my sister's wedding. It's very important, it just came up and might clash with the dates. Is that a reason insurance would pay back?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, thank you for that specific example. So, you require information on trip cancellation coverage, specifically inquiring if cancelling due to a family event like your sister's wedding would be covered. I've noted that specific circumstance as a requirement you need addressed. Often, cancellation for personal events like weddings might fall under exclusions, but we'll ensure the options presented address this point clearly."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Oh. Okay. I see. Thanks for noting it down. I feel so clueless about all this."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "You're asking all the right questions to ensure you get the information you need. Just one last thing for now, do you have a particular budget in mind for the insurance policy per person?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Um, maybe? We're hoping to spend $200-$300 each, if possible. Is that realistic?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, noted the budget preference of $200-$300 per person. Thank you. So, just to quickly summarize the main points you've highlighted as important for your travel insurance: You need coverage for general medical expenses during the trip, cover specifically related to hiking activities, assistance if your luggage is lost or damaged, help with expenses if your travel plans are significantly delayed, and cover if you need to cancel your trip, including understanding the situation regarding cancelling for your sister's wedding. Is that correct?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Yes, I think that covers it. Sorry if I was confusing."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Not at all, you were very clear. Thank you for providing all these details. I have gathered all the necessary requirements based on our conversation. This information will help in finding suitable options for you."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Okay, great. Thank you for your help, Priya."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "You're most welcome. Thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd. Have a good day!"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "You too, goodbye."
