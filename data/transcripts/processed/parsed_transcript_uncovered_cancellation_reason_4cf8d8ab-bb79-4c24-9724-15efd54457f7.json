        "dialogue": "Good morning, thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd. My name is Sarah. How may I help you gather your travel insurance requirements today?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Finally! Took long enough to get through. Yes, I need travel insurance. And I need it sorted quickly, I don't have all day."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Certainly, I can help with gathering the details needed. To start, could you let me know where you'll be travelling to from Singapore?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Australia. We're based in Singapore, obviously."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, Australia. And how long will your trip be?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Three weeks. It's a trip for 2 of us."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Three weeks for two travelers to Australia. Thank you. And may I know the approximate age group of the travelers?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "We're mostly around 41-55 years old. Why does that matter? Just get me the best plan."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "It helps understand the general profile for insurance needs. Thank you. Will you be participating in any specific sports or adventure activities during your trip?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Yes, we plan to do White Water Rafting. Make sure that's fully covered. I don't want any issues if something happens. It needs to be covered, period."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, I've noted down the requirement to consider coverage related to participation in white water rafting. Are there any particular health aspects I should note, for instance, any pre-existing medical conditions for either traveler?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Look, one traveler has high blood pressure, but it's managed. That shouldn't exclude anything. I expect full medical coverage regardless. We pay enough for insurance."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Thank you for sharing that. I'll note down the need for medical coverage information, taking into account declared pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure. What about concerns regarding your belongings during the trip?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Absolutely! My luggage is expensive. If it gets lost or damaged, I expect immediate reimbursement, not some runaround. And if it's delayed, I need money for essentials right away, not after waiting 12 hours."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Understood. So, a requirement for coverage related to lost, damaged, or delayed baggage, including reimbursement for essential purchases during delays. Are there any other potential disruptions you're concerned about, such as flight delays?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "You bet! Flights are always delayed these days. If our flight gets significantly delayed and we need extra accommodation or meals, ISS needs to cover that. No excuses."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Noted. So, coverage requirements related to significant travel delays causing additional expenses like accommodation and meals. Is there anything else regarding potential interruptions, perhaps needing to cancel the trip before it starts?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Yes, actually. This is very important. There's a small chance my sister might schedule her wedding during our travel dates. If she does, I *have* to cancel this trip and attend. I need absolute certainty that I will be fully reimbursed if I cancel for her wedding. This is non-negotiable. I've been a loyal customer for years, so I expect this flexibility."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, I understand. So, you specifically require information on trip cancellation coverage, and critically, you want to know if cancelling to attend your sister's wedding would be a covered reason under the policy. I have noted this specific scenario as a key requirement."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Good. Make sure it *is* covered. Don't come back to me with fine print saying it's not. I want a supervisor if needed. Our budget is flexible, just make sure all this is included."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Thank you. Let me quickly summarize the requirements I've noted down for your trip to Australia for two travelers, age group 41-55, for three weeks. You require information on: Medical Coverage, considering a pre-existing condition of high blood pressure; coverage for Lost, Damaged, or Delayed Luggage; coverage related to participating in White Water Rafting; coverage for expenses due to significant Travel Delays; and Trip Cancellation coverage, with a specific query about cancellation due to needing to attend your sister's wedding. Have I captured all your main requirements correctly?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Yes, that sounds about right. Especially the cancellation for the wedding â€“ that's the main thing besides the usual coverage. Don't mess it up."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Thank you for confirming. I have logged all these requirements. We will use these details to identify potential options. Thank you for calling ISS Insurance."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Alright. Fine. Goodbye."
