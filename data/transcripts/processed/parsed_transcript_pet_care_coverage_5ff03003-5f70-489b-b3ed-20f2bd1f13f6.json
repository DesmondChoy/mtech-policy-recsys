    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Finally! Took long enough to get through. Look, I need travel insurance, but frankly, after my last experience with you people, I'm not expecting much. It was a complete mess."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "I understand your frustration, sir, and I'm sorry to hear about your previous experience. I'll do my best to assist you efficiently today. To start, could you please tell me where you'll be traveling to?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "We're planning a trip to the UK. And don't try to sell me the most expensive plan just because it's long haul. I want proper coverage, not excuses later."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Noted, the destination is the UK. And how long will you be traveling for?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "It will be a 3 weeks trip. Starting from Singapore, obviously."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Alright, 3 weeks in the UK, departing from Singapore. And how many people will be traveling on this policy?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "There will be 2 of us traveling. Both adults."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, two travelers. Could you let me know which age group the travelers fall into? Is it 18-25, 26-40, 41-55, 56-65, or 65 plus?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "We're mostly around 41-55 years old. And make sure your policies actually cover people in that age group properly, unlike some fine print I found last time."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Understood, the travelers are in the 41-55 age group. Are there any pre-existing medical conditions I should be aware of, like asthma, diabetes, or high blood pressure, for example? Or any special medical equipment needed during the trip?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "No special medical equipment needed. But yes, one traveler has high blood pressure. Do we need to declare high blood pressure? I hope you actually cover things properly this time if something medical happens overseas, not find some ridiculous exclusion clause! What kind of medical help is even covered?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Thank you for letting me know about the high blood pressure. Duly noted. Are you planning on participating in any specific sports or adventure activities during your trip, such as skiing, scuba diving, or hiking?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "No, no special activities planned. Just normal sightseeing. But what if we have to cancel the whole trip before we even go? Say one of us gets sick, properly sick, not just a cold. Your company was completely useless when my cousin had to cancel last year! Will we get our money back or just more excuses?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, no specific adventure activities planned. And regarding your budget for the insurance policy, do you have a range in mind, perhaps $100-$200, $200-$300, around $400, or is it flexible?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Our budget for insurance is flexible, but don't think that means I'll pay for rubbish! I expect full value. Especially considering the absolute nightmare last time when our flight back was delayed by 8 hours and we got absolutely nothing for the hassle and extra meals. What happens if the flight gets delayed significantly this time? Are you going to leave us stranded again?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, noted the flexible budget."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "And don't even get me started on luggage! My bag arrived damaged on my last trip insured with you, and the claim process was deliberately difficult, asking for receipts from years ago. It's ridiculous! What’s the point if you don't cover lost or damaged bags properly? I expect that to be covered without a massive fight."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Understood, cover for luggage is important."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Look, another thing. This is very important. If our flight *is* delayed coming back to Singapore, significantly delayed I mean, what happens with my cat? She'll be in a pet hotel here. If I can't get back on time, I have to pay extra days. Will you cover the extra cost for that pet boarding? Because nobody could give me a straight answer last time, and it's a real worry."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, thank you for clarifying all that. Let me just quickly summarize the requirements you've mentioned to ensure I've captured everything correctly. You're planning a trip to the UK for 3 weeks for two travelers aged 41-55, departing from Singapore. One traveler has high blood pressure, which needs to be considered for medical coverage overseas. You require cover for potential trip cancellation due to reasons like illness. You also need cover for significant travel delays, including associated costs, and for lost or damaged luggage. And specifically, you require clarification and coverage for additional pet accommodation costs for your cat should your return to Singapore be delayed. Have I noted all your main requirements correctly?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Yes, that’s what I need. That's the minimum I expect. Make sure it’s actually covered this time, properly covered."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Thank you for confirming, sir. I have documented all these requirements. We will use this information to identify suitable policy options. Someone from our team will be in touch shortly to discuss these options with you."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Fine. Just make sure they call soon and have actual answers, not just sales talk."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "They will reach out as soon as possible. Thank you for your time today. Goodbye."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Alright, goodbye."
