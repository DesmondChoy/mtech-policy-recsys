Does your policy offer a double payout for accidental death specifically if it occurs while traveling as a fare-paying passenger on scheduled public conveyance like a bus or train?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",

    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "That covers the main points I needed to clarify for now. Our budget for the insurance premium is around $400 for the two of us."
