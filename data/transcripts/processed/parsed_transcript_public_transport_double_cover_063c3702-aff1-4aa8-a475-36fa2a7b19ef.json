        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
        "dialogue": "Okay, comprehensive trip cancellation cover for specified unforeseen events. What about potential delays during the journey itself?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "dialogue": "Yes, given the destination and time of year, travel delay coverage is important. I'm looking for clear terms on the minimum delay duration required to trigger the benefit, and coverage for consequential expenses like meals and necessary accommodation."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer",

I want to specifically confirm and require a provision for double indemnity payout under the Accidental Death benefit if the incident occurs while the insured person is travelling as a fare-paying passenger on public transport â€“ like a bus, train, or ferry during the trip."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
