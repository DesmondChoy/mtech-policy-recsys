Customer Service Agent: Good morning! Thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd Singapore. My name is Janna. How may I assist you today?

Customer (Know-It-All): Morning, Janna—though I’m sure I already know how this goes. I’m looking at travel insurance for my upcoming trip, and since I’ve read up on everything under the sun about insurance, let’s cut straight to the chase, can we?

Customer Service Agent: Certainly, I’d be happy to help. First, could you let me know which aspects of coverage are most important to you?

Customer (Know-It-All): Well, obviously, I won’t risk traveling without the essentials: trip cancellation, medical expenses—especially if something goes sideways—and let’s not forget emergency evacuation. I’m well aware of how crucial that is. I’m also quite certain I need baggage loss or delay coverage, and, naturally, travel delay coverage for any flight hiccups.

Customer Service Agent: Thank you for clarifying. Just to ensure I fully understand: you need coverage specifically for trip cancellation, medical expenses, emergency evacuation, baggage loss or delay, and travel delay. Is that correct?

Customer (Know-It-All): Precisely. It’s not like I’d miss any key coverage details, but it’s good to hear you confirm it.

Customer Service Agent: Great! So, to confirm:

Trip Cancellation

Medical Expenses

Emergency Evacuation

Baggage Loss/Delay

Travel Delay

I have them all noted. Are there any other concerns or requirements you would like us to keep in mind?

Customer (Know-It-All): No, I think we’ve covered the full suite of coverage. Nothing else for now.

Customer Service Agent: Fantastic. Thank you for providing these details. We’ll use this information to better understand your needs. If you don’t have any other questions at this time, I can wrap up our discussion.

Customer (Know-It-All): Yeah, that should do it. I know my stuff, so I trust this process is straightforward from here.

Customer Service Agent: Excellent. I appreciate your time today, and we’ll be in touch if we have any clarifications. Thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd Singapore. Enjoy the rest of your day!

Customer (Know-It-All): Sure thing. Thanks. Have a good one.
