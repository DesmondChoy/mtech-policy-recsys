Customer Service Agent (Agent - Siti): Good morning, thank you for calling ISS Insurance, Singapore. My name is Siti, how may I assist you today?

Customer (Customer - Mrs. Tan): Good morning, Siti! So lovely to speak to a real person so quickly! You know, these days it’s all machines and buttons, so refreshing to hear a friendly voice. I’m calling about travel insurance, you see. My husband and I are finally taking a trip, haven't had a proper holiday in ages, what with work and everything. Just thinking about it puts a smile on my face!

Agent Siti: That’s wonderful to hear, Mrs. Tan! A holiday is definitely something to look forward to. To help you with your travel insurance inquiry, could you tell me a bit more about your trip?

Customer Mrs. Tan: Of course, of course! We are going to Japan! Always been a dream of mine to see the cherry blossoms. We're going for two weeks, leaving on the 15th of March and coming back on the 29th of March. So exciting! Have you been to Japan, Siti? It’s supposed to be so beautiful.

Agent Siti: Japan is indeed a popular destination, Mrs. Tan. To process your travel insurance request, may I know the year of birth for both you and your husband, please?

Customer Mrs. Tan: Oh yes, of course, the important details! Let me see… I was born in 1968, and my husband, Mr. Tan, he’s from 1965. So, I'm… let me quickly calculate… that makes me 56, and he's 59. Getting on a bit, aren't we? But still young at heart, especially for travel! And we are both Singaporean citizens, by the way, just in case that matters.

Agent Siti: Thank you for that information, Mrs. Tan. And yes, being Singaporean residents is helpful. Just to confirm, it will be two adults travelling, Mrs. Tan and Mr. Tan?

Customer Mrs. Tan: That’s right, just the two of us this time. Though sometimes our daughter joins us, she's working overseas now, in London. Such a long way away! But for this trip, it’s just us old folks, haha! We are not exactly ‘old’, but you know, compared to the youngsters…

Agent Siti: Understood, Mrs. Tan. And for your travel insurance, are you looking at a specific type of coverage? For example, are you interested in basic coverage, or something more comprehensive that includes things like trip cancellations or higher medical coverage?

Customer Mrs. Tan: Hmm, good question. We were thinking something in the middle, you know? Not the bare minimum, but we don’t need all the bells and whistles either. Something that covers medical stuff, definitely, especially with our age, you never know! And maybe something for if our luggage gets lost, that would be a nightmare! But we are generally quite healthy and careful travelers, touch wood! [Mrs. Tan knocks lightly on her desk] So, maybe the ‘standard’ kind of coverage? What do most people in Singapore take, you know?

Agent Siti: Thank you for letting me know your preferences, Mrs. Tan. To confirm, you are looking for travel insurance for two Singaporean adults, Mrs. Tan (born 1968) and Mr. Tan (born 1965), travelling to Japan from March 15th to March 29th. You are interested in a coverage type that is more than basic, including medical and luggage protection, but not necessarily the most comprehensive option. Is that correct?

Customer Mrs. Tan: Yes, Siti, you've got it exactly right! Perfect summary! You’re very efficient, and so friendly too! It’s really a pleasure talking to you. I was a bit worried calling, thinking it would be complicated, but you’ve made it so easy.

Agent Siti: Thank you for your kind words, Mrs. Tan. Just to reiterate, I have noted your requirements for travel insurance for two adults to Japan from March 15th to 29th, with standard coverage including medical and luggage protection. We will use these requirements to prepare some options for you.

Customer Mrs. Tan: Wonderful, Siti! That sounds perfect. What happens next? Will someone get back to me?

Agent Siti: Yes, Mrs. Tan. Based on the information you have provided, our team will prepare some suitable travel insurance options for your consideration. You will be contacted within the next 24 to 48 hours by one of our insurance specialists to discuss these options further.

Customer Mrs. Tan: Oh, that’s so quick! Excellent service, really! Thank you so much for your help, Siti. You’ve been absolutely lovely. Have a wonderful day!

Agent Siti: You’re most welcome, Mrs. Tan. Thank you for calling ISS Insurance. Have a pleasant day and enjoy planning your trip to Japan! Goodbye.

Customer Mrs. Tan: Goodbye, Siti! And thank you again! [Call ends]
