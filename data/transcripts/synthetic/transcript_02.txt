Customer Service Agent: Good morning, thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd, Singapore. My name is Sarah, how may I assist you today?

Customer: Yes, hello, look, I need to get travel insurance sorted. I’m travelling soon and need to know what you’ve got. Just get to the point, alright?

Customer Service Agent: Certainly. To help me understand your needs better, could you please tell me the age and gender of all travellers who require insurance?

Customer: Right, me – I’m 35, male. And my wife, she’s 32, female. Is that all you need? This shouldn’t take forever.

Customer Service Agent: Thank you. And where will you be travelling to?

Customer: Europe. Just Europe. Is that enough? Seriously, I haven't got all day for this.

Customer Service Agent: Yes, Europe is the continent. To provide the most relevant options, could you specify the countries you intend to visit within Europe? For example, are you travelling to countries in the Schengen area or primarily to the UK?

Customer: Look, it’s all of it! Everywhere! France, Italy, Spain… and the UK too. Just assume it’s the whole lot, okay? Just give me the options for Europe, all countries. Is that so hard?

Customer Service Agent: Understood, all European countries, including the UK. And what are your intended travel dates, please?

Customer: We’re leaving on the 15th of July and coming back on the 29th of July. Two weeks exactly. Write that down.

Customer Service Agent: Yes, 15th of July to 29th of July. Will there be any senior citizens, that is anyone aged 70 and above, included in this travel insurance policy?

Customer: No! Just me and my wife, like I already said! No senior citizens, no kids, just us two. Are you even listening to me?

Customer Service Agent: Yes, Sir, I am. Just confirming all details. Finally, do you have a specific type of coverage in mind? For example, are you looking for basic coverage, or a more comprehensive plan that includes things like trip cancellation or winter sports coverage?

Customer: Comprehensive! Obviously comprehensive! Why would I want basic? I want everything covered. Delays, medical, lost luggage, the whole shebang. The best one you’ve got. Just quote me on the best, most comprehensive plan for Europe, for two adults, travelling July 15th to 29th. Got it?

Customer Service Agent: Yes, Sir, I have all the details. To confirm, you require a comprehensive travel insurance plan for two adults, a 35-year-old male and a 32-year-old female, travelling to all European countries including the UK, from July 15th to July 29th. Is this correct?

Customer: Yes, finally! That’s it. Now what? How long is this going to take?

Customer Service Agent: Thank you for confirming. I have noted all your requirements. We will now process this information internally to prepare the suitable plan options for your consideration. We will contact you back within the next working day with a quote. Is there anything else I can assist you with at this moment?

Customer: Working day? Seriously? Okay, fine. Just make sure you call me first thing tomorrow. And don’t waste my time with rubbish options.

Customer Service Agent: Understood, Sir. We will endeavour to contact you as early as possible tomorrow with relevant options based on your requirements. Thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd. Have a pleasant day ahead.

Customer: Yeah, whatever. Bye. [Customer hangs up].
