      "dialogue": "Good morning, thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd. My name is Sarah. How can I help you today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Oh, hello Sarah. Yes, I need help... I think. I need to get travel insurance, but I'm really quite confused about it all. Sorry, this is my first time doing this properly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "No worries at all, I can certainly help guide you through the process of noting down your requirements. Could you start by telling me where you'll be travelling to?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Okay, thank you. We're planning a trip to Japan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Japan, lovely. And how long will you be away for?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "It will be a 2 weeks trip. Yes, two weeks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, Japan for two weeks. And how many people will be travelling?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "There will be 2 of us travelling. Just me and my partner."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, two travellers noted. And roughly, what age group are the travellers in?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We're mostly around 26-40 years old. Is that important? Sorry, I don't know these things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "It helps us understand the context, thank you. Now, could you tell me what aspects of travel insurance are important to you, or what worries you might have about the trip?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Worries... yes, lots! Like, what if one of us gets sick? In Japan? Hospitals there are expensive, right? Does insurance help pay for things like... seeing a doctor, or if we need to stay in hospital? What does that cover exactly? I find the terms very confusing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, so cover for potential medical expenses incurred during your trip is one requirement. Understood. Are there any existing health conditions for either traveller that you're thinking about?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Oh, yes! My partner has asthma. Do we need to declare asthma? Is that... complicated? What if the asthma gets bad there because of the weather? Sorry for all the questions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Noted that one traveller has asthma and you have questions regarding declaration. Thank you for sharing that. What other concerns do you have regarding the trip?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Well... what happens if we can't even go? Like, if maybe the asthma thing gets very serious just before we leave, or some other emergency happens and we have to cancel the whole holiday? We've paid for flights and hotels... do we just lose all that money? Is there something for... cancelling the trip?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, so you're also interested in understanding cover if you need to cancel your trip for certain reasons before you depart. Noted. What else comes to mind?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Hmm. The flight itself. Sometimes there are long delays, right? I've heard stories. Like if we get stuck at the airport for many, many hours... Does insurance help? Like, for food, or maybe a hotel if we're stranded overnight? That would be horrible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood. So cover related to significant travel delays causing extra expenses is another point you'd like noted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, that's it. And luggage! I always worry the airline will lose our suitcases. Or what if they arrive all smashed up? Is there... umm... help for that? Replacing things if our bags get lost or damaged?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, so cover related to lost, damaged, or delayed baggage is also a requirement. Noted. Thinking about your activities in Japan over the two weeks, are you planning anything specific like sports or adventure activities?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Oh! Funny you ask. We were thinking... maybe trying skiing? Just for a day, easy slopes! Nothing dangerous. But... what if someone falls and breaks a leg? Does normal insurance cover skiing injuries? Or is that separate? I feel so lost with what's included or not."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Right, so you're interested in cover for potential injuries while participating in specific activities like skiing. Noted. Is there anything else? Perhaps a budget you have in mind for the insurance itself?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Ah, yes, the cost. Um. It all sounds like it could add up. We were hoping to spend maybe $200-$300 for the insurance for both of us for the two weeks. Is that realistic? I have no idea really. Sorry."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, noted the budget indication of around $200-$300. Thank you. Let me quickly summarize the requirements you've mentioned needing information on for your trip to Japan for two people. You're looking for details on medical expense coverage, including how pre-existing conditions like asthma are handled; trip cancellation cover; assistance during significant travel delays; cover for lost or damaged luggage; and cover for participating in sports activities like skiing. You've also indicated a budget preference of around $200-$300. Does that sound correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, I think... I think that covers all the main things I was confused about. Medical, cancelling, delays, bags, and the skiing. And the asthma question. Yes, that's right. Thank you for being patient."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "You're welcome. Thank you for outlining your requirements clearly. I have noted all these points down. Someone from our team will review these requirements and get back to you with relevant information and options."

      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Oh, okay. Great. Thank you so much for your help, Sarah."
