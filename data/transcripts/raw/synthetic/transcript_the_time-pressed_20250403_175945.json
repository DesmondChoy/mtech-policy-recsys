    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Hi Siti, yes, I need travel insurance. I'm really short on time, so can we do this quickly? Just need the essentials."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Certainly, I can help you with that. To understand your needs, I just need a few details about your trip first. Could you tell me where you'll be travelling to?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Japan. Look, I don't need a whole lecture, just the coverage. We're planning a trip to Japan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, Japan. And how long will your trip be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "About 2 weeks. Just two of us going."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Noted, Japan for 2 weeks, for two travellers. And may I know the age group of the travellers?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We're mostly around 26-40 years old. Right, so standard medical cover is a must, obviously. Accidents, getting sick, that sort of thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood, medical coverage is a key requirement. Are there any pre-existing conditions for either traveller?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "No, no pre-existing conditions. But listen, we plan to do some skiing. Is that covered? Like if there's an accident on the slopes? Need that sports thing included."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, so coverage for medical expenses including for specified sports like skiing. Noted. Any other specific activities or concerns regarding the destination?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Well, yeah, with everything going on... what if there's some trouble? Like political unrest or... worse? Is there any cover for that sort of situation, like war breaking out or something? Need to know if that's an option."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, I've noted your interest in coverage related to war and political unrest scenarios. Thinking about the journey itself, any concerns regarding potential disruptions?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Definitely! If the flight gets delayed for hours and we're stuck, need cover for extra hotel nights or meals. Hate waiting around. And also, what if we have to cancel the whole trip *before* we go? Like if one of us gets seriously ill? That needs to be covered, the cancellation costs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, so coverage for significant travel delays and for trip cancellation due to unforeseen events like illness. Understood. Is there anything else you specifically want covered? Perhaps regarding your belongings?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Oh, yes! Luggage! If the airline loses our bags or smashes them up, need compensation for that. It's happened before, nightmare. So, lost or damaged luggage cover too. Is that everything? What's the typical cost? We're hoping to spend $200-$300 for the insurance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Thank you for providing those details and the budget indication. Let me quickly summarize the key requirements you've mentioned for your 2-week trip to Japan for two travellers, aged 26-40, with no pre-existing conditions. You're looking for: Medical Coverage, coverage for Sports and Adventure Activities like skiing, cover related to War and Political Unrest, protection against significant Travel Delays, Trip Cancellation cover, and Lost or Damaged Luggage cover. Does that sound correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, yes, that's it. That covers the main worries. Just need the options and the price fast, okay?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood. I have recorded all your requirements. I will pass this information to our specialist team who will prepare the relevant plan options based on your needs and budget. They will reach out to you shortly with the details."
    },
    {
