      "dialogue": "Good morning, thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd. My name is Sarah, how may I help you today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Morning, Sarah! Wow, your voice sounds so chipper today, must be the good weather, finally some sun after all that rain, hor? I'm calling about travel insurance, got a trip coming up soon! Very exciting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Good morning! Yes, the weather is lovely today. I can certainly help you with travel insurance inquiries. To start, could you please let me know where you'll be travelling from?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Oh yes, we're based in Singapore, born and bred! Always start our adventures from Changi, best airport, right? We're planning a trip to Japan! Finally going, you know. Been planning this for ages. My partner kept seeing all these amazing food pictures on Instagram, so she was like, \"Okay, MUST GO!\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "That sounds wonderful! Japan is a fantastic destination. And could you tell me how long you'll be away for?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We'll be away for 2 weeks. Just enough time to hopefully see Tokyo and maybe squeeze in a trip to Kyoto. You been before? Any tips? Ah, but anyway, yes, 2 weeks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Two weeks sounds like a good duration. And how many people will be travelling on this policy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Just the two of us this time. Easier to manage, you know? Last time we went with friends, coordinating was like herding cats! Haha! So yes, just 2 travelers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood, two travelers. And may I know which age group the travelers fall into? We have brackets like 18-25, 26-40, 41-55, and so on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Ah, the dreaded age question! We're mostly around 26-40 years old. Still young enough to enjoy ourselves properly, lah!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Noted, 26-40 age group. Now, just a couple of standard questions regarding health. Do any of the travelers have any pre-existing medical conditions, like asthma or diabetes, for example?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Oh, no, thankfully none of that. Touch wood! We are both quite healthy, try to eat well, except when on holiday, of course! Then all bets are off, especially in Japan! No, no pre-existing conditions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "That's good to hear. And do you require coverage for any specific medical equipment, like a wheelchair or CPAP machine?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Nope, nothing like that needed. We're travelling pretty light on the medical front!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, great. You mentioned seeing Tokyo and Kyoto. Are there any specific activities you have planned during the trip? Sometimes certain activities require specific mention."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Good question! We're not super adventurous, not like bungee jumping or anything crazy, haha! But we definitely plan to do some Hiking. Saw some beautiful trails near Mount Fuji, thought it would be nice to get out of the city. So yes, We need coverage for Hiking."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, noted hiking. So, coverage for certain activities like that is something you're looking for. Thank you. Is there anything else specific you're concerned about or want to ensure is covered for this trip?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Well, obviously, the main thing is if one of us gets sick or has an accident, right? You hear stories... need to make sure hospital stays or seeing a doctor over there won't cost us an arm and a leg. So, definitely need solid Medical Coverage. Very important."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood, medical coverage is a key requirement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "And you know lah, the airlines these days... always worry about the luggage. Last time my cousin went to Europe, her bag took a detour to somewhere else entirely! Took three days to get it back. Stressful! So, coverage if the bags get lost or damaged, or even delayed, that would be good. Need money to buy essentials if the bag goes missing, right? Lost/Damaged Luggage cover, yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, coverage for lost, damaged, or delayed luggage. Noted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Also, flights getting delayed. Seems to happen more often now, hor? If we get stuck somewhere overnight because the flight is super late, does insurance help cover hotel or meals? That kind of thing. Travel Delays cover?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Right, cover for expenses due to significant travel delays. I've made a note of that requirement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "And... fingers crossed nothing happens, but what if we have to cancel the whole trip beforehand? Like, if someone gets seriously ill or something major happens? Trip Cancellation cover is standard, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Yes, Trip Cancellation coverage for certain specified reasons like serious illness is a common feature. I've noted that down."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Okay, good, good. Ah, but here's a specific one I need to ask about. My sister, right, she just announced her wedding date, and it *might* clash with our travel dates. We're still trying to confirm things, but if it turns out we absolutely have to be back for her big day, and we have to cancel the Japan trip because of it... is that covered? I need to know if I'm covered if I have to cancel my trip for my sister's wedding, it's a really important family event."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, I understand. So, you have a specific requirement to understand if cancelling the trip due to a family event like your sister's wedding would be covered under Trip Cancellation. I have noted this specific query down. Typically, reasons like changing plans for events might fall under exclusions, but I have noted it as a requirement you need clarity on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yeah, exactly. Need to know what's what for that situation. Itâ€™s making me a bit nervous, you know? We're quite flexible on the budget for the insurance itself, probably around $400 or maybe a bit more? The main thing is getting the right cover, especially with these points in mind."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood regarding the budget flexibility and the focus on coverage needs. Thank you for sharing all that information. Just to confirm, I have noted the following requirements for your travel insurance inquiry: You're travelling from Singapore to Japan for 2 weeks, 2 travelers in the 26-40 age group, with no pre-existing conditions or special medical equipment needs. You require information on plans that include Medical Coverage, Lost/Damaged Luggage cover, Travel Delay benefits, coverage for Sports and Adventure activities specifically mentioning Hiking, and Trip Cancellation coverage. Crucially, you also need specific clarification on whether Trip Cancellation would cover cancelling due to a significant family event like your sister's wedding. Does that summarise everything correctly?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, Sarah, that sounds perfect! You got everything down. You're very efficient, much better than trying to figure this all out online, bouncing between pages, you know? Much nicer talking to a real person!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Thank you. I'm glad I could help capture your requirements today. I have logged all these details. The next step would be for our sales team to look at suitable plans based on these needs and get back to you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Okay, great! Thanks so much for your help, Sarah. Really appreciate you listening to all my rambling! Have a lovely day!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "You're most welcome! Thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd. Have a great day too, and enjoy planning the rest of your trip to Japan! Goodbye."

      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Thanks again! Bye bye!"
