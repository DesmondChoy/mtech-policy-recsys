You require coverage for medical emergencies, lost or damaged luggage, significant travel delays, and trip cancellation, including a specific check on cancellation due to attending a family wedding. You also need cover for hiking activities, have no pre-existing conditions or special medical equipment, and have a budget preference of around $200-$300. Is that all correct?"
