      "dialogue": "Thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd Singapore. My name is Sarah. How may I help you today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, I need travel insurance. And make it quick, I don't have all day. I'm a long-time customer, you know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Certainly, I can help you with that. To start, could you please let me know where you'll be travelling from?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We're based in Singapore, obviously. Where else would I be calling from?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood. And where are you planning to travel to?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We're planning a trip to Europe. Several countries."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, Europe. And how long will the trip be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "It will be a 3 week trip. A proper holiday, not some short break."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Three weeks in Europe. And how many people will be travelling?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "There will be 2 of us traveling. Both adults. We're mostly around 41-55 years old."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, two adults, 41-55 age group, for three weeks to Europe. Are there any specific activities you have planned during your trip that we should be aware of?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, we plan to do White Water Rafting. It's non-negotiable, so your policy *must* cover this properly. No funny business about 'high-risk exclusions' applying to me. I expect full coverage if anything happens during that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, noted. You require coverage that includes white water rafting. And regarding health matters, do you or your travel partner have any pre-existing medical conditions we should note?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Look, one traveler has high blood pressure, but it's managed. Don't try and use that as an excuse later. I expect proper medical coverage, full stop. If something happens, even related to that, ISS needs to pay up. Hospital stays, doctors, whatever is needed. Don't tell me about pre-existing condition clauses; they shouldn't apply to loyal customers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "I understand you're looking for comprehensive medical cover. And will you be bringing any specific medical equipment, like a CPAP machine or wheelchair?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "No, no special medical equipment needed. But my luggage is expensive. Last time I flew, the airline scratched my suitcase. I want complete coverage if my bags are lost, damaged, or even delayed. And I expect immediate reimbursement for essentials if there's a delay, none of this 'wait 6 hours' nonsense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Right, so coverage for baggage is important, including loss, damage, and delay aspects. Thinking about the travel itself, are you concerned about potential disruptions?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Of course, I am! Flights are always getting delayed these days. If our flight is delayed significantly, I expect ISS to cover hotels, meals, the lot. And not just for major delays – any significant disruption caused by the airline messing up needs to be covered. Don't quote minimum hours at me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood, you have concerns regarding travel delays and require coverage for associated expenses. What about the possibility of needing to cancel the trip beforehand?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "This trip is costing a fortune. If *anything* forces us to cancel – illness, family issue, whatever – I expect a full refund. I don't want to hear about standard exclusions like work reasons or changing my mind, I need flexibility. I pay enough for this insurance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, so trip cancellation coverage is a key requirement for you. You mentioned travelling to several countries in Europe. Are there any specific regions you're visiting where stability might be a concern?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We're going near Eastern Europe. With all the nonsense going on over there near Ukraine, I absolutely need cover if some political unrest or war breaks out and affects our trip. Don't tell me \"travel advisories\" this or \"foreseeable events\" that. If things go bad *after* I buy the policy, I expect ISS to cover evacuation, medical, cancellation, everything related to it. It's essential."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Thank you for sharing those details. Just to confirm, I've noted down the key areas of coverage you require for your three-week trip to Europe for two adults: Comprehensive medical coverage, including for pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure; specific cover for participating in white water rafting; robust protection against lost, damaged, or delayed luggage with immediate support for delays; coverage for expenses arising from significant travel delays; flexible trip cancellation cover; and specific cover related to war or political unrest affecting your travel. Is that correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, that's the minimum I expect. And I trust you'll ensure the policy reflects this without any hidden catches. Don't make me call back and speak to a manager."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "I have recorded all your requirements. Thank you for providing this information. This will help in finding the appropriate plan details for you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Fine. Make sure it's handled properly. Goodbye."
