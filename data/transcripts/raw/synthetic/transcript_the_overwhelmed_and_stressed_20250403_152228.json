      "dialogue": "Thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd. My name is Sarah. How may I assist you today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Oh, hello? Yes, hi Sarah. I... I need to ask about travel insurance. It's just... everything is so much right now. I'm trying to plan this trip, but my head is spinning. I don't even know where to start. It’s all very stressful."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "I understand planning can feel overwhelming, Madam/Sir. Take a deep breath, I'm here to help clarify what you might need. Can you tell me a bit about your concerns regarding the trip? What are you worried might happen?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Worried? Oh goodness, worried about *everything*! What if... what if I get sick? Or my mum, she's not been too well... what if something happens to her right before I'm supposed to leave and I just... can't go? All that money... gone! It’s just… too much pressure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, so one concern is needing coverage in case you have to cancel your trip beforehand due to unforeseen circumstances like illness, either yours or a close family member's?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes! Exactly! That's a huge weight on my mind. And then... what if I actually *go* and something happens *there*? Like, I fall down, or get some awful infection? The thought of being in a foreign hospital... the bills... I just... I can't handle that thought."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, so cover for medical expenses incurred during your trip is another important point for you. This would typically include things like doctor visits or hospital stays overseas."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, yes, medical costs. And... and what if it's really bad? Like, really serious, and I need to get flown back home, or to a proper hospital somewhere else? How does that even work? It sounds terrifying, being stuck far away and needing urgent help."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood. So you're also asking about coverage for emergency medical evacuation or repatriation, meaning transport back home or to a suitable medical facility if it's a serious emergency?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, that too. Oh dear. And the travel itself! You know how flights are these days. What if the plane is stuck on the tarmac for hours and hours? Or I miss a connection because of a delay? Last time I travelled it was chaos, stuck overnight... the extra hotel cost, meals... it was a nightmare! Does insurance help with that kind of mess?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, so you're also interested in understanding coverage for significant travel delays, which might help with unexpected accommodation or meal costs due to long delays?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes! Because it happens! It really does! And... oh, the luggage! Don't get me started on the luggage. What if they lose my suitcase? Or it shows up three days late? Or it arrives all smashed up? All my clothes, my things... just thinking about replacing everything, or having nothing to wear... it makes me feel sick with anxiety."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Right, so cover for baggage issues is also a requirement – meaning situations where your baggage is lost, damaged, or significantly delayed by the airline?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, please. That's definitely something I worry about. It feels like so many things can go wrong."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, Madam/Sir, thank you for sharing your concerns. Please allow me to just quickly recap what you're looking for in terms of travel insurance coverage, to make sure I've captured everything correctly. You're interested in cover for:"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Oh... yes. Yes, I think that covers... all the big worries. It's a lot, isn't it? But yes, that's what I need to know about. Thank you for listing it out, my mind feels a bit clearer now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "You're welcome. I'm glad I could help clarify the requirements you have. I have noted these points down. Thank you for calling ISS Insurance today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Okay. Yes. Thank you, Sarah. Bye."
