      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Good morning, thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd. My name is Sarah. How may I help you today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Oh, hello Sarah. Yes, um, I'm planning a trip, you see, and I'm just... I'm really quite worried about things going wrong. I need to understand what travel insurance covers. I get very anxious about these things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, I understand travelling can bring up some concerns. I can certainly help note down the areas of coverage you're interested in learning more about. Could you tell me what specific situations you're worried about?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Well, first off, what if... what if I have to cancel the whole trip before I even go? Like, if I suddenly get very sick, or maybe something happens to my elderly parents? It's a lot of money paid upfront, you know? I'd be devastated to lose it all. Is that something insurance can cover? The cancellation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, so you're interested in understanding coverage for situations where you might need to cancel your trip before departure due to unforeseen events like illness. I've noted that down. What else is on your mind?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, exactly. Then... what about *during* the trip? What if I fall down or catch some terrible bug overseas? Hospital bills can be astronomical! I've heard horror stories. Does the insurance cover doctor visits, or if I need to stay in a hospital, or get medicine? What if it's really serious?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, so cover for medical expenses incurred during your trip, such as emergency treatment, hospital stays, and doctor visits, is another area you'd like information on. Noted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, definitely. And... linked to that... what if it's *really* bad? Like, I need to be flown back to Singapore urgently, or maybe moved to a better hospital in another city? That sounds incredibly expensive. Is that kind of emergency transport covered? That's a big worry for me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood. So information regarding coverage for emergency medical evacuation or repatriation back home is also important for you. I have added that to the list."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Okay, good, good. Then there's the luggage. Oh gosh, what if the airline just loses my bag completely? All my clothes, my necessities... gone! Or what if it just doesn't arrive for days? Will insurance help me buy some essential things while I wait? Or what if the suitcase itself arrives all smashed up? I worry about my belongings."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Right, so you're also concerned about potential issues with your baggage, whether it's lost, delayed, or damaged during transit. You'd like to know about coverage for replacing items or purchasing essentials. Noted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, that's it. And... one more thing... delays. What if the flight is delayed for ages? Like, stuck on the tarmac, or cancelled and rescheduled for the next day? I could miss a connecting flight, or need a hotel room overnight, and extra meals... Does insurance help with those unexpected costs if the travel plans get significantly delayed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, I understand. So you're also looking for information on coverage for expenses incurred due to significant travel delays, such as accommodation or meals. I've noted that down as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Phew, okay. Yes, I think those are the main things constantly running through my head. It's just... you want to be prepared for the worst, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "I understand completely. So, just to summarize and confirm, you're looking for information specifically on these aspects of travel insurance coverage: first, Trip Cancellation before you depart; second, Medical Expenses incurred during your trip; third, Emergency Evacuation or repatriation; fourth, Baggage Loss, Delay, or Damage; and finally, Travel Delay expenses. Have I captured your main areas of concern correctly?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes... yes, that sounds right. Those are all the big 'what ifs' that keep me up at night before a trip. Are you sure that covers everything I mentioned?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Yes, based on what you've told me, those five points cover the specific scenarios you raised concerns about: cancelling the trip, getting sick overseas, needing emergency transport, issues with luggage, and significant travel delays. I have clearly noted these requirements."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Okay..."
    }
