      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Good morning, thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd. My name is Sarah, how may I help you today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Morning, Sarah! Wow, your voice sounds so cheerful today, lah! Much better than the weather outside, hor? Raining cats and dogs since morning. I'm Mrs. Tan here, calling about travel insurance. We're finally going on a proper holiday! First big one since... oh my goodness, must be before the whole COVID thing. Remember how crazy that was? We were supposed to go to Japan, booked everything, then *bam*, lockdown! So disappointing, really."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Good morning, Mrs. Tan! Yes, it's quite wet out there. I'm glad you're planning a holiday now, that sounds exciting after such a long wait! I can certainly help you with travel insurance inquiries. To start, could you tell me where you'll be travelling to and when?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Ah yes, the important details! We're going to Europe! Specifically, Switzerland and a bit of Italy. Very exciting! My daughter just finished her A-levels, so it's a celebration trip. We'll be going for about 3 weeks, leaving early next month. So much planning, you know? Booking hotels, trains... reminds me of planning my wedding, but less stressful, haha! Though my husband might disagree!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Switzerland and Italy for 3 weeks sounds wonderful! A great way to celebrate. And who will be travelling on this trip? Just yourself, your husband, and your daughter?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, just the three of us. My husband, myself, and Cheryl, that's my daughter. She's 18, just entered the 18-25 group, you know? Makes me feel old! My husband and I are... let's just say comfortably in the 41-55 bracket, haha! Feels like just yesterday we were backpacking ourselves. Time flies, really."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, so that's three travellers: two in the 41-55 age group and one in the 18-25 group, travelling from Singapore to Europe for 3 weeks. Got it. And are you planning any specific activities during your trip? Sometimes certain activities require special attention for insurance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Oh, absolutely! That's the main reason Cheryl wanted Switzerland – she wants to try skiing! Can you believe it? We are tropical people! I'm more excited about the cheese fondue, personally. But yes, she definitely wants to hit the slopes, maybe snowboarding too if she's brave enough. So we definitely need to make sure any accidents during skiing or snowboarding are covered. You know teenagers, lah, fearless! Last time we went kayaking in Krabi, my husband nearly capsized, so funny! But skiing feels a bit more... risky? So, coverage for that is important."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, noted. So you're looking for coverage that includes activities like skiing and potentially snowboarding. Duly noted. Besides the activities, are there any other specific concerns or areas of coverage you have in mind for this trip?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, definitely. Number one is medical stuff. Touch wood, nothing happens, but travelling so far... you hear stories, right? My neighbour’s cousin went to the US last year, had appendicitis! The bill was astronomical! So, good coverage for doctor visits, hospital stays, emergencies... that's crucial. Especially with the skiing, hor? And my husband has mild high blood pressure – it's well-controlled, but does that affect anything? We need to know how pre-existing conditions are handled."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, comprehensive medical coverage including emergencies and hospitalisation is a priority. And thank you for mentioning the high blood pressure; understanding how pre-existing conditions are treated is important. I've noted that down. What else is on your mind?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Well, the luggage! Oh my goodness, the stress. Years ago, we flew to Hong Kong, and the airline lost my suitcase for three days! Nightmare! Had to buy toiletries, some clothes... Luckily it turned up, but imagine if it was lost completely? Or damaged? My husband just bought a fancy new suitcase, he'd have a fit if it got wrecked. So, yes, cover for lost or damaged bags, and maybe if they are delayed like last time? Need to be able to buy essentials."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood. So, coverage for baggage issues – loss, damage, and delay, including reimbursement for essential purchases during a delay. Noted. Any other scenarios you're thinking about?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Hmm, let me think... Ah! Delays! Not just luggage delays, but the actual travel. Flights, trains... Europe has so many connections. What if our flight from Singapore is delayed and we miss our connecting train in Zurich? Or stuck somewhere overnight? Happened to my sister flying back from London once, stuck in Dubai for 12 hours! Need something that covers extra hotel nights or meals if we get significantly delayed. Don't want the holiday ruined right at the start, or end!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Right, protection against significant travel delays, covering potential costs like extra accommodation and meals. That makes sense. I've added that to the list."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "And, you know, touch wood again, but what if something major happens before we even leave? Like if one of us gets really sick, or there's a family emergency back home, God forbid? We'd have paid for flights, hotels... it's a lot of money down the drain if we have to cancel last minute. So, trip cancellation protection is definitely something we need to understand. Does it cover illness?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, so cover for trip cancellation due to unforeseen events like serious illness or family emergencies is another requirement. Noted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "One last thing, Sarah. Maybe it sounds silly... but you see the news sometimes, things happening around the world... protests, unrest... Europe is generally stable, lah, but... is there any kind of cover if, say, there was some unexpected political trouble or unrest that pops up where we are? Like, needing to leave suddenly or if something happens because of it? Just a 'what if', you know? Better safe than sorry. My friend went to Thailand during that coup years back, quite scary for her."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, I understand. You're asking about coverage related to unforeseen events like war or political unrest affecting your travel area. I've noted that as a point of interest for coverage details. We're travelling from Singapore, by the way. Almost forgot to say!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Perfect, thank you Mrs. Tan. So, just to summarise the key areas of coverage you're interested in for your 3-week family trip to Europe:"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, Sarah, that's perfect! You've captured everything. It’s such a relief talking it through. You know, planning trips is fun but also a bit stressful, making sure all bases are covered. You've been very helpful, really listening! Not like some automated thing, haha!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "I'm glad I could help clarify your requirements, Mrs. Tan. Understanding your needs is the first step. I have all the details noted down now. Thank you for calling ISS Insurance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Thank you so much, Sarah! Have a lovely day, stay dry! Bye bye!"
