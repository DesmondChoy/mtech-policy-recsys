    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, we plan to do some Hiking. It's important that the policy provides adequate coverage under the 'Sports and Adventure Activities' benefit for potential medical expenses or evacuation arising from this.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes. Firstly, regarding potential disruptions before departure, I need details on the 'Trip Cancellation' benefit â€“ specifically the covered perils, for instance, cancellation due to serious illness or injury of a traveller or a close family member."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, noted the requirement for details on 'Trip Cancellation' coverage triggers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Secondly, relating to disruptions during the journey, I'm interested in the scope of the 'Travel Delays' benefit. What are the typical provisions for meals and accommodation, and what minimum delay duration usually activates this benefit?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood, clarification required on 'Travel Delays' benefits, including minimum duration and coverage specifics."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Finally, a very specific point I've seen in some policy wordings: I want to know if the policy provides extra coverage, specifically a double payout or doubled indemnity, for accidental death if it occurs while traveling as a fare-paying passenger on scheduled public transport, like a bus or train."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, I understand. You're specifically asking about a provision for a potential double payout under the Accidental Death benefit if the incident occurs on public transportation. Noted as a key requirement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Thank you for providing those details. It helps clarify your needs. Do you have a particular budget range in mind for the premium for the two travellers?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Our budget for insurance is about around $400."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood, budget around $400 noted.
