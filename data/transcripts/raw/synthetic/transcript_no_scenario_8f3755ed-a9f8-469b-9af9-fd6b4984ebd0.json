      "dialogue": "Thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd Singapore. My name is Sarah. How may I help you today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Hi Sarah, I need travel insurance, quite urgently. I don't have much time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, I can help you with that. Could you please tell me where you'll be travelling to?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We're planning a trip to Japan. Now, what's the quickest way to get this sorted?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood. And how long will you be away for?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "It will be a 2 weeks trip. We're based in Singapore, travelling from here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, Japan for two weeks, departing from Singapore. And how many people will be travelling?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "There will be 3 of us traveling. Can we skip the small talk? I need to know the basics are covered."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Certainly. To understand your needs better, could you tell me the general age group of the travellers?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We're mostly around 41-55 years old. Okay, so what if something happens before we go, like someone gets sick? We need to be able to get our money back if we have to cancel the whole thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, so you're looking for information on coverage for expenses if you need to cancel your trip due to covered reasons like illness?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, exactly. Trip cancellation. And medical stuff while we're there is crucial. What if one of us needs a doctor or, worse, ends up in hospital?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, noted. Coverage for emergency medical treatment, hospital stays, and doctor visits during the trip is a requirement. Are there any pre-existing conditions I should be aware of?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "No, no pre-existing conditions. And no special medical equipment needed either. What about delays? Last time my flight was delayed for hours, it was a nightmare."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "I understand. So you'd require coverage for potential additional expenses like accommodation or meals due to significant travel delays?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes! Absolutely essential. And our bags! What happens if the airline loses our luggage or it arrives damaged? Need cover for that too. Don't want to be stuck buying everything again."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood, coverage regarding lost, damaged, or delayed baggage is important for you. Are you planning any specific activities during your trip? Perhaps any sports or adventure activities?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We plan to do some Hiking during our trip. Nothing extreme, just regular trails. Is that covered under the medical part if someone twists an ankle?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, so you need coverage for medical expenses potentially related to participation in activities like hiking. Noted. Is there a particular budget you have in mind for the insurance?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Our budget for insurance is flexible, just want to get the right coverage quickly. So, Hiking is okay?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "I've noted your requirements regarding the activities. Just to confirm, the main points you need covered are: Trip Cancellation, Medical Coverage for emergencies during the trip, cover for Travel Delays, protection for Lost or Damaged Luggage, and medical cover related to participating in Hiking activities. Is that summary correct for the three travellers, aged 41-55, going to Japan for two weeks from Singapore?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, yes, that sounds right. That's what we need. Can you get me a quote now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Thank you for confirming. I have recorded all your specific requirements. I will pass this information to our sales team who can prepare the relevant options and quotes for you. They will be in touch shortly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Okay, fine. Make sure it's quick. Thanks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Will do. Thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd. Have a good day."
