      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Good morning, thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd. My name is Sarah. How may I help you today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, look, I need travel insurance, and frankly, I'm already frustrated. Your website is useless, and I had a terrible experience with another company last year that cost me a fortune. I need to make absolutely sure I'm getting the right coverage this time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "I understand your frustration, sir, and I'm sorry to hear about your previous experience and the difficulty with our website. I'll certainly do my best to gather all your requirements accurately today. Could I start with your name, please?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "David Tan. Look, Sarah, I just need proper cover, not excuses later. Can you just tell me what you need to know?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Certainly, Mr. Tan. To understand your needs, could you tell me where you'll be travelling to from Singapore?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We're planning a trip to Australia. Me and my wife."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, Australia. And how long will the two of you be away for?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "It will be a 2 weeks trip. And before you ask, we're both in the 41-55 age group, no pre-existing conditions to worry about, thankfully. Had enough trouble with that last time claiming for something else."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Thank you for that information, Mr. Tan. Two travelers, 41-55 age group, travelling from Singapore to Australia for two weeks. Noted. What are the main activities planned during your trip?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "This is the main point! It's a golf trip. And I'm sick and tired of standard policies not covering anything properly. I need specific coverage for my golf equipment – proper coverage, mind you, if it gets lost or smashed by some careless baggage handler."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, so coverage specifically for golf equipment is a key requirement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes! And what happens if I get sick or injured and can't play? I'll have paid for green fees that I can't use. I expect reimbursement for unused green fees. That seems only fair."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, reimbursement for prepaid, unused green fees due to unforeseen circumstances like illness or injury. Understood."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "And those golf buggies! What if I accidentally damage one? It's probably happened before. I need to know I won't be footing a massive bill if there's an accident with a golf buggy. Is that covered?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "So, coverage for liability or damage concerning rental golf buggies. I've noted that down as well, Mr. Tan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Good. And one more thing for golf – it might sound silly, but I've heard some policies offer a little something extra, a benefit, if you score a hole-in-one. It's a celebration thing. Does ISS offer anything like that? I want that included if possible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, a specific benefit related to achieving a hole-in-one during the trip. I've added that to your requirements list. Are there any other specific activities planned besides golf?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "No, just golf. But obviously, the usual things need to be covered. I absolutely need solid medical coverage. If something happens, I expect proper emergency treatment, hospital stays, the works, without ridiculous exclusions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood, comprehensive medical coverage for emergencies during the trip."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "And luggage! Aside from the golf clubs, what about our regular bags? Last time, the airline delayed my bag for two days. I need coverage if luggage gets lost, damaged, or delayed like that again. It's completely unacceptable when that happens."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Noted. Coverage for loss, damage, or delay of general baggage, including cover for essential purchases if it's delayed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes. And what about delays? Flight delays, missed connections... it's a nightmare. If the airline causes a significant delay, I expect the insurance to cover extra hotel nights or meals. It's their fault, but someone needs to pay."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, coverage for additional expenses like accommodation and meals resulting from significant travel delays."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "And finally, trip cancellation. If something serious happens – like one of us gets really sick before we go, or a family emergency – we need to be able to cancel and get our money back for flights and hotels. It’s only right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Right, coverage for trip cancellation due to specified reasons like illness, injury, or family emergencies. Understood, Mr. Tan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, Mr. Tan, let me quickly summarize the requirements I've noted down for your two-week trip to Australia for two travelers. You require standard coverage for trip cancellation, emergency medical expenses, lost/damaged/delayed luggage, and significant travel delays. Crucially, you need specific golf-related coverage including protection for your golf equipment, reimbursement for unused green fees if you're unable to play, cover for potential damage to a rental golf buggy, and a benefit for achieving a hole-in-one. Have I captured everything correctly?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, that sounds about right. Especially the golf cover – that absolutely has to be watertight. Make sure all those points are included. No excuses later if something happens."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood, Mr. Tan. I have recorded all these requirements. Thank you for detailing your needs clearly. This information will help find the suitable options for you. Is there anything else I can note down for you today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "No, that's it. Just make sure someone gets back to me with a proper plan that covers *everything* I mentioned."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "We will certainly process your request based on these requirements. Thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd, Mr. Tan. Have a good day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Alright. Goodbye."
