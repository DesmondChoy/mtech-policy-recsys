      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd Singapore. My name is Priya, how may I assist you today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, finally. I need travel insurance. We're planning a trip to Europe. We're based in Singapore, obviously."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Certainly, I can help gather your requirements for a quote. Could you let me know the duration of your trip and how many people will be travelling?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "It's for 3 weeks. There will be 2 of us traveling. Look, I've been a loyal ISS customer for ages, so I expect the best coverage, understand?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Thank you for that information, noted. And may I know the approximate age group of the travellers?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We're mostly around 41-55 years old. Don't try selling us some basic plan meant for youngsters."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood. Are there any specific activities you plan to participate in during your trip to Europe?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We plan to do some Hiking. Nothing extreme, but if something happens, ISS better cover it. I don't want any excuses about 'high-risk activities' not being covered if we twist an ankle or something."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, noted hiking as an activity. For planning purposes, are there any health considerations or pre-existing medical conditions we should be aware of for either traveller? Or any specific medical equipment you might be bringing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Well, one traveler has high blood pressure, but it's managed. Don't tell me that's going to be an issue for coverage, that would be ridiculous. It better not exclude anything related to that. No special equipment needed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Thank you for letting me know about the high blood pressure. So, general medical cover for emergencies during the trip is important?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Of course it is! What kind of question is that? Hospital stays, doctors... the works. And what if we have to cancel the whole thing before we even leave? Things happen. Illness, family emergencies... I expect full reimbursement for our flights and hotels if we can't go. Don't try to nickel-and-dime me on covered reasons."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, so trip cancellation protection is a requirement. What about potential issues during the travel itself?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Like what? Flight delays? Yes, absolutely. These airlines are completely unreliable nowadays. If we get stuck somewhere because of a major delay, ISS needs to pay for decent hotels and meals until we can get going again. And don't quote me some silly minimum delay like 12 hours before coverage kicks in, it needs to be reasonable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Noted, cover for significant travel delays causing additional expenses."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "And luggage! Don't get me started. They always seem to lose or damage bags between connections. I need proper reimbursement if my things go missing or turn up broken. Not some token amount that barely covers a toothbrush. It needs to cover the actual value."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, coverage for lost, damaged, or delayed baggage. Are there any other specific concerns or situations you need cover for?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, actually. This is very important. We have a cat here in Singapore. If our flight back is delayed significantly – say, by a day or two – we need coverage for the extra costs of keeping her in the pet hotel or kennel. That absolutely must be included, no arguments. It's a direct consequence of a travel delay."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, I've noted that specific requirement: cover for additional pet accommodation costs, like a pet hotel for your cat, if your return to Singapore is delayed due to a covered reason."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Good. Make sure it's properly covered. What about the budget? You need to know that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "It helps us find suitable options. Do you have a specific budget range in mind for the premium? Perhaps $100-$200, $200-$300, around $400, or is it flexible?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "My budget is flexible, but that doesn't mean you can overcharge me. I expect top-tier service and coverage for a fair price, especially given my loyalty. Just get this done right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright. So, just to confirm the requirements I've gathered for your quote: Travel insurance for 2 adults, age group 41-55, travelling from Singapore to Europe for 3 weeks. Key requirements include: Comprehensive Medical Coverage, accounting for one traveller with high blood pressure; Trip Cancellation protection for major reasons like illness or family emergency; cover for significant Travel Delays including accommodation and meals; substantial Lost or Damaged Luggage protection; specific coverage for Hiking activities; and a specific provision for additional pet accommodation costs in Singapore if your return trip is significantly delayed. Is that correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, that sounds about right. Make sure that pet hotel part is definitely in there, no ambiguity. And I expect a competitive quote promptly. If there are any issues with the quote or the coverage detail isn't clear, I'll need to speak to a manager directly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Thank you for confirming. I have noted all your requirements clearly. We will use this information to identify suitable plan options and prepare a quotation for you. Someone will be in touch regarding the next steps."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Fine. Make it quick. Don't waste my time."
