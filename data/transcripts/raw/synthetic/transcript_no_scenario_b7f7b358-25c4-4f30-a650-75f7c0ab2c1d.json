    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Hi, look, I'm really pressed for time. I need to get travel insurance sorted quickly. Can we just get straight to it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Certainly. I understand you're busy. To make sure we capture the right details, could you let me know where you'll be travelling to?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Japan. We're planning a trip to Japan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, Japan. And how long will you be away for?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "It will be a 2 weeks trip. Flying from Singapore, obviously."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, noted. Two weeks to Japan, starting from Singapore. And how many people will be travelling?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Just two of us. We're mostly around 30, so the 26-40 age group I guess."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, two travellers, age group 26-40. And regarding your trip, are there any specific activities planned or any particular concerns you have that you'd want the insurance to potentially cover?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, definitely. We plan to do some hiking. Nothing extreme, but you know, someone could fall. So medical stuff needs to be covered properly if we need a doctor or hospital there. That's important."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood, coverage for medical treatment during the trip, including potential incidents during hiking."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yeah, and what about luggage? If the airline loses it or damages it? Need cover for that nightmare scenario. Happened to a friend, took ages. Need reimbursement fast."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, so coverage for lost or damaged luggage is a requirement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Correct. Also, flights these days... always delayed. What happens if we get stuck somewhere for hours, miss a connection, need a hotel overnight? That needs to be covered. I can't afford to waste time or money on that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, so cover for significant travel delays causing extra expenses is something you require."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes. And the big one – what if we have to cancel the whole trip before we even go? Like, unexpected illness, family emergency back home? Can't just lose all the money paid for flights and hotels. Need trip cancellation cover for sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, noted. Protection against trip cancellation due to covered reasons like illness or emergencies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Exactly. That's the main stuff. No, no pre-existing conditions to worry about, and no special medical equipment needed. Just the standard things plus the hiking, medical, bags, delays, cancellation. Got all that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Yes, let me quickly summarise to ensure I have everything correct. You're looking for travel insurance for two adults, age group 26-40, traveling from Singapore to Japan for two weeks. Your key requirements are: Medical Coverage, Lost/Damaged Luggage protection, specific cover for Hiking activities under Sports and Adventure, cover for significant Travel Delays, and Trip Cancellation protection. You've also confirmed no pre-existing medical conditions or special medical needs for this trip. Is that accurate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, that sounds right. That's everything. So, what’s the next step? How quickly can I get this quote?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Thank you for confirming. I have noted down all your requirements. To proceed with generating the appropriate quotes for you, I would need to capture your name and contact details."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Fine, fine. Let's do that then. Just email it over ASAP."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Certainly. Could I please have your name and email address?"
    },

      "speaker": "Customer",
