    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Oh, hello Sarah. Yes, umm... I need to ask about... travel insurance? I think that's what it's called. I'm going on a holiday soon, and my daughter said I must get it, but honestly, I'm very confused about all this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "No worries at all, I can certainly help gather some information about what you might need. Could you tell me a bit about what aspects of travel insurance you're interested in finding out more about? What are you concerned about for your trip?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Concerned? Uh... well, what if... what if something happens and I can't even go on the trip? You know, like if I suddenly fall sick just before I fly? Do I just lose all my money for the flight and hotel?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, I understand. So, one area you're interested in is cover if you need to cancel your trip beforehand due to certain unexpected reasons, like falling ill?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes! Exactly that. Cancel... trip cancellation, is it? Sorry, these terms are all new to me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "That's perfectly alright. Yes, that's generally called trip cancellation cover. Noted. Are there any other concerns you have, perhaps about things that could happen *during* the trip itself?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "During the trip... Oh dear. Yes, what if I get sick *while* I'm overseas? Going to a doctor or hospital there sounds very scary... and expensive. Does insurance help with that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, so you're also looking for information on cover for medical costs if you need treatment while you are travelling? This could include things like seeing a doctor or needing a hospital stay?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, please. That sounds important. Medical costs... okay."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Noted. Cover for Medical Expenses. Anything else related to medical situations?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Um, well... what if it's something really serious? Like, really bad? And I need to... maybe get to a better hospital, or even come back to Singapore quickly? Is that..."
