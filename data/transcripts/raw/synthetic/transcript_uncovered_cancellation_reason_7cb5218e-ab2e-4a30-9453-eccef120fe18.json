      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Noted, two travellers in the 26-40 age group. Will you be participating in any specific activities during your trip to Japan, perhaps any sports?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, skiing. We'll be participating in skiing. Make sure that's covered. And obviously, the basics – what if we need a doctor or something over there? That's covered, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, so I've noted down coverage required for skiing and for emergency medical treatment during the trip. Are there any other potential mishaps you're concerned about?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes! Flights. What if the flight is delayed for hours and we miss a connection or something? And our bags – what if they get lost or damaged? Put that down."

      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood. So, coverage for significant travel delays and for lost or damaged luggage. Noted."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yeah, obviously need cover if we have to cancel beforehand. But look, here’s a specific thing – I need to know if I'm covered if I have to cancel my trip for my sister's wedding. It’s happening just before we're supposed to leave. If dates clash, I absolutely cannot miss it. Is that covered?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, I understand. You need coverage for trip cancellation in general, and you have a specific requirement regarding cancellation cover if you need to attend your sister's wedding. I will note this specific scenario down as part of your requirements. It's worth noting that cancellation due to family events like weddings might fall under specific policy terms, but I have recorded your need for this information."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Fine, just make sure it's noted. Is that everything? Budget is flexible, just get me something sorted fast."

    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, let me just quickly summarize the requirements I've gathered. This is for two travellers, aged 26-40, travelling from Singapore to Japan for 10 days. You require coverage information regarding: Emergency Medical expenses, Trip Cancellation, including a specific query about cancellation for a family wedding, significant Travel Delays, Lost or Damaged Luggage, and specific coverage for participation in Skiing. You've also confirmed no pre-existing medical conditions. Does that sound correct?"
    },
