      "dialogue": "Good morning, thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd. My name is Sarah. How may I assist you today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Oh, hello Sarah. Yes, um, I need to ask about insurance. For travel? My wife and I are planning a trip, and someone said we need this. I'm a bit lost with all this, honestly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Not a problem at all, I can certainly help gather the details of what you might need for your travel insurance. Could you tell me where you'll be travelling from?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, we're based in Singapore. We'll be traveling from Singapore."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, noted. And where are you planning to travel to?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We're planning a trip to Australia."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Australia, lovely. And how long will you be away for?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "It will be a 2 weeks trip."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, two weeks in Australia. And how many people will be travelling, including yourself?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Just the two of us. It's a trip for 2."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood, two travellers. And could you let me know the general age group for both travellers?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We're mostly around 41-55 years old."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, 41 to 55. And are there any specific activities you have planned during your trip? Anything adventurous perhaps?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Well, we might do some light hiking, nothing too strenuous. But the main reason we're going is for golf. Lots of golf."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Golf, noted. And regarding the golf activities, are there any specific concerns or types of coverage you have in mind related to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes! That's the main thing, actually. I really need to make sure my golf equipment, my clubs, are covered. What if they get lost or damaged by the airline? And, um, what if I get sick or something and can't play? We pay for the golf course fees beforehand, you see. Can I get that money back? Also, I worry about those golf carts, the buggies? If I accidentally damage one, is that covered? Oh, and my friend told me some policies give you something special if you score a hole-in-one? Is that a real thing? Sorry, lots of questions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "No need to apologise at all, it's good to know exactly what you're looking for. So I've noted down: coverage specifically for your golf equipment, reimbursement for unused green fees if you're unable to play due to unforeseen reasons, coverage for accidental damage to a rented golf buggy, and a benefit related to achieving a hole-in-one. And you mentioned some hiking as well, so coverage related to sports and activities. Is that correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, that sounds right. It’s all a bit confusing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "We'll take it step by step. Now, regarding medical aspects, do either of the travellers have any pre-existing medical conditions we should be aware of, for example, conditions like asthma or high blood pressure?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Ah, yes. My wife has high blood pressure. It's managed with medication. Do we need to declare high blood pressure? What does 'pre-existing' mean exactly? And just generally, what if one of us just gets sick over there, like a bad flu, needs to see a doctor? Is that covered?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, I've noted the high blood pressure. Pre-existing conditions are typically medical conditions known before the policy starts. And you're inquiring about general medical coverage for unexpected illness or injury during the trip, like doctor visits or hospital stays?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, exactly. Just in case. We don't need any special equipment, no wheelchair or anything like that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood, no special medical equipment needed. Thank you for clarifying. Now, thinking about potential disruptions, are you concerned about situations like your trip needing to be cancelled before you leave? For example, if one of you became seriously ill?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Oh yes, definitely. What happens if we have to cancel the whole thing last minute because one of us is unwell, especially with the high blood pressure thing? We'd lose all the money for the flights and hotel. So, yes, trip cancellation cover is important. Sorry, is that what it's called?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Yes, that relates to Trip Cancellation coverage. And what about issues during the actual travel journey? For instance, concerns about your flight being significantly delayed, or about your checked luggage?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Ah yes! The luggage. Especially with my golf clubs, I worry they might get lost or broken. So, cover for lost or damaged luggage would be good. And delays too! My colleague had a terrible experience once, stuck at the airport for hours and hours. Does insurance help with that, like for hotel or food if we get stuck?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, so you're also interested in coverage for potential travel delays, like for accommodation or meals due to the delay, and also for loss or damage to your baggage during the trip."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, that's right. I think that covers everything I’m worried about. It’s quite a lot, isn't it? Sorry for being a bit slow."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Not at all, it's important to understand your needs fully. So, just to quickly summarise the key requirements you've mentioned: Medical coverage for illness or injury during the trip, cover for potential trip cancellation, assistance for significant travel delays, protection for lost or damaged luggage, coverage for sports activities including hiking, and specifically for your golf trip, coverage for your golf equipment, unused green fees, accidental damage to golf buggies, and a hole-in-one benefit. You also mentioned one traveller has high blood pressure, which has been noted. Does that sound like a complete picture of what you're looking for?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, I think that’s everything. You explained it much clearer than my friend did. Thank you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "You're very welcome. Thank you for providing all those details. I have gathered all your requirements now. The next step is for our team to look into suitable options based on these needs. Someone will be in touch with you regarding potential plans and quotes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Okay, great. Thank you so much for your help, Sarah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "You're welcome. Thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd. Have a good day!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "You too, bye bye."
