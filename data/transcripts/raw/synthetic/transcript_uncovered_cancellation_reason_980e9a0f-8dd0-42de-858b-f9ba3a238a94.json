    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Hi Priya, yes, quickly please. I need to sort out travel insurance. Very busy today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood. I can certainly help gather your requirements. Could you tell me where you'll be travelling to?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Thailand. Leaving from Singapore, obviously."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Noted, Thailand. And how long will your trip be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "10 days. Look, can we speed this up? I just need the standard stuff."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "I understand you're short on time. To ensure we note everything correctly, I just need a few more details. How many people will be travelling?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Two of us. Both around 30, so maybe the 26-40 age group, whatever that is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, two travellers, age group 26-40, travelling from Singapore to Thailand for 10 days. Are there any particular activities you plan on doing there? Sometimes specific activities require noting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, yes, we plan to do some scuba diving. So make sure that's covered."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, noted potential coverage needed for scuba diving. And regarding health, are there any pre-existing medical conditions I should note for any traveller?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "No, nothing like that. But obviously, we need medical coverage, right? If something happens, hospital bills, doctors, that kind of thing. Standard."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood, so coverage for emergency medical needs during the trip is a requirement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, obviously. And what about if the flight gets massively delayed? Stuck in Bangkok or something. We'll need cover for hotels, food, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, so you require cover related to significant travel delays."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes. And luggage! Always worried the airline will lose it or break it. Need cover for lost or damaged bags."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Got it, requirement noted for lost, damaged, or delayed baggage."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Right. Now, the main thing – cancellation. If something unexpected comes up, like, we get sick or there's a family emergency, we need to be able to cancel and get our money back for the flights and hotel."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, so coverage for trip cancellation due to specific unforeseen events like illness is a requirement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, but specifically – what if I have to cancel because of a family event? Say, my sister suddenly moves her wedding date right into our trip dates? It's important, I'd have to cancel the trip. Is that covered? Need to know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Thank you for specifying that. So, you have a requirement to understand if cancellation due to a significant family event, like your sister's wedding date changing, would be covered. I've noted this specific cancellation scenario as a requirement you need addressed. Standard cancellation policies often have specific covered reasons, so this is an important point to clarify."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Okay, good. Just make sure that's listed as something I need info on. So, is that everything you need? I really have to go."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Almost done. Just to quickly summarize the requirements you've mentioned: Coverage for emergency medical expenses, lost or damaged luggage, significant travel delays, trip cancellation for standard reasons like illness, cover for scuba diving activities, and specifically, clarification on cancellation cover if you need to cancel due to a family event like your sister's wedding. Is that all correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, yes, that's it. Medical, luggage, delays, diving, cancellation, and the wedding thing. Got it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Perfect. Thank you for providing those details. I have noted all your requirements. We will use this information to identify suitable options. Someone will be in touch shortly. Thank you for calling ISS Insurance."
