      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Right. So, just to confirm the requirements I've noted for your travel insurance enquiry: The trip is for 2 people to Australia for 10 days, departing from Singapore. You require standard coverage for medical emergencies, trip cancellation, travel delays, and lost or damaged luggage. You also specifically require coverage for hiking activities. For golf, you need cover for the equipment, reimbursement for unused green fees, liability for golf buggy damage, and a hole-in-one benefit. Is that all correct?"
