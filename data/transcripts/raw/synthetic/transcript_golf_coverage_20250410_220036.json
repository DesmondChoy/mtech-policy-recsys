      "dialogue": "Thank you for calling ISS Insurance Ltd. My name is Sarah. How may I assist you today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Finally, someone answered! Look, I need travel insurance, and frankly, I hope this experience is better than the last time I dealt with insurance. Absolute rubbish service trying to claim previously."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "I understand you've had frustrations previously, sir. I'm here to help gather the details for your current travel insurance needs. Could you tell me a bit about your upcoming trip so I can note down the requirements? Where are you travelling to?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Fine. We're planning a trip to Australia. Two of us are going."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, Australia for two travellers. And how long will you be away for?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We'll be away for 2 weeks. And before you ask, we're mostly around 41-55 years old."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Noted, two weeks for two travellers in the 41-55 age group, heading to Australia. To ensure we understand the type of coverage you might need, could you tell me about the main purpose or activities planned for this trip?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "It's mainly a golfing holiday. And that's where I expect proper coverage, not excuses! I need my golf equipment covered if it gets lost or smashed by those baggage handlers. And what happens if something goes wrong, like a flight is delayed for ages, and I miss my pre-paid tee time? I expect reimbursement for unused green fees! This is precisely the kind of thing insurance should cover but often doesn't."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, I've noted coverage for golf equipment and reimbursement for unused green fees due to unforeseen circumstances. Are there any other specific golf-related concerns?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes! Those golf buggies. If I accidentally damage one on the course, is that covered? And I saw some policies overseas mention a benefit if you score a hole-in-one. Do you offer anything like that? It's supposed to be a holiday, after all!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood. So, specific cover for accidental damage to a golf buggy and inquiring about a potential hole-in-one benefit. I've added these to the list. Apart from the golf, are there any other general concerns for this trip? Things you want to make sure you're protected against?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Of course! The usual worries. What if one of us gets sick or injured over there? Medical bills in Australia aren't cheap, you know. So proper medical coverage is essential. And flights these days are a mess – what if there are massive travel delays and we get stuck, needing extra accommodation or meals? That needs covering."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, so comprehensive medical coverage for illness or injury during the trip and coverage for additional expenses due to significant travel delays."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, and baggage! Not just the golf clubs, but our suitcases too. Lost luggage, damaged bags, delays getting them – it's a basic requirement! And what if something major happens *before* we even leave? Like a serious illness or a family emergency forcing us to cancel the whole trip? I won't be out of pocket for flights and hotels because of that!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Noted. Coverage for lost, damaged, or delayed luggage, and also trip cancellation cover for unforeseen events like illness or emergencies prior to departure. Thank you. To make sure we get the most accurate information, are there any pre-existing medical conditions for either traveller that we should be aware of?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, my husband has high blood pressure. Do we need to declare high blood pressure? Always feels like you're looking for reasons not to cover things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Thank you for letting me know. Yes, it's standard procedure to note pre-existing conditions. I've added high blood pressure to the details. And regarding the cost, do you have a particular budget in mind for the insurance policy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We're hoping to spend around $400. But for that price, I expect everything we've discussed to be properly included, no funny business in the fine print."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, I have noted the budget indication of around $400. So, just to confirm the requirements I've gathered for your 2-week trip to Australia for two travellers: You need standard medical coverage, trip cancellation protection, cover for travel delays, and protection for lost, damaged, or delayed luggage. Additionally, you have specific requirements for golf cover, including protection for your golf equipment, reimbursement for unused green fees due to covered reasons, cover for accidental damage to a golf buggy, and you'd like information on any available hole-in-one benefits. We've also noted one traveller has high blood pressure. Is that correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, that sounds about right. Make sure all those points, especially the golf specifics, are looked into properly. I don't want any nasty surprises."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood. I have recorded all these requirements. We will use this information to identify suitable options. Someone from our team will be in touch shortly to discuss the policies that match these needs. Thank you for contacting ISS Insurance Ltd."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Alright. I'll wait for the call then. Goodbye."
