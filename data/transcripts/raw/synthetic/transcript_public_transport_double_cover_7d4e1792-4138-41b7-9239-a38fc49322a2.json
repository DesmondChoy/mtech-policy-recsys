      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Good morning, thank you for calling ISS Insurance. My name is Sarah, how may I assist you today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, I need travel insurance. And make it quick, I don't have all day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Certainly. To help find the right information for you, could I start with a few details about your trip? Where will you be travelling from?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We're based in Singapore, obviously. That's why I'm calling ISS, isn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Of course. And where is your travel destination?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We're planning a trip to Europe. A proper tour."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Europe, noted. And how long will you be away for?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "It will be a 3 weeks trip."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Thank you. And how many people will be travelling under this policy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "There will be 2 of us traveling. Both experienced travelers, I might add. I've been an ISS customer for years, you know. Home, car, the lot. So I expect good service."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "We appreciate your loyalty. Could I also ask the general age group of the travelers?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "We're mostly around 41-55 years old. Fit and active."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, 41-55 age group. And regarding your trip to Europe, are there any specific activities you plan to participate in that might require specific mention, like adventure sports?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Look, we're not bungee jumping, but we plan to do some hiking. Nothing extreme, but if someone slips and needs medical attention for it, that absolutely has to be covered. No excuses."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Alright, noted. Coverage for hiking activities. Are there any other specific activities?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "No, just the hiking mainly. Sightseeing, relaxing. But things go wrong, don't they? What if our luggage gets lost or damaged? My suitcases are expensive, I expect proper reimbursement, not just a few dollars. And if it's delayed, I need to buy clothes immediately, that needs paying for."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood. So, you require coverage for lost, damaged, or delayed baggage. Noted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, comprehensive cover. And medical is absolutely vital. One of us has high blood pressure – it's managed, but hospitals overseas are expensive. I expect any necessary doctor visits or hospital stays to be fully covered, no ifs or buts about pre-existing conditions. That's standard, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, I'm noting your requirement for comprehensive medical coverage, including considerations for doctor visits, hospital stays, and you've mentioned a pre-existing condition of high blood pressure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Good. And what about delays? Flights get cancelled or delayed all the time. If we're stuck somewhere, I expect ISS to cover a decent hotel and meals until we can get moving again. Don't tell me I have to wait 12 hours or something ridiculous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Noted. You require cover for additional expenses like accommodation and meals due to significant travel delays."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Exactly. And trip cancellation too. If something serious happens – like illness, or a family emergency back home – and we have to cancel the whole thing, I need to know we'll get our money back for flights and hotels. No rubbish excuses."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Okay, requirement for trip cancellation cover due to unforeseen covered reasons like illness or emergencies. Noted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Right. Now, one very specific thing I saw mentioned with other insurers. I want to know if your policy offers double the payout for accidental death if, God forbid, it happens while travelling on public transport – like a train or a bus over there. That's a key requirement for me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Understood. You are specifically requesting confirmation on a benefit providing a double payout for accidental death occurring specifically while using public transport overseas. I have noted that requirement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "You better have. Look, my budget is flexible, but I expect top-tier coverage for everything I've mentioned. I don't want the basic package. Given my history with ISS, I expect this to be handled properly. If these requirements are a problem, I need to speak to someone senior right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "I understand your requirements clearly. Allow me to quickly summarize the key areas of coverage you need noted for your quote preparation. You require: Comprehensive Medical Coverage, with specific attention to pre-existing high blood pressure; coverage for Trip Cancellation; Lost, Damaged, or Delayed Luggage cover; Travel Delay benefits covering accommodation and meals; cover for injuries sustained during hiking activities; and crucially, the specific benefit of a double payout for accidental death occurring on public transport. Have I captured all your main requirements correctly?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Yes, that sounds about right. Make sure all of that is included when someone prepares the options. I don't want any nasty surprises in the fine print."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Thank you for confirming. I have documented all these requirements. The next step is for our team to prepare travel insurance options based specifically on these needs for your 3-week trip to Europe for two travelers. Someone will be in touch with those details. Is there anything else I can note for you today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "No, that's it. Just get it done properly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer Service Agent",
      "dialogue": "Thank you for calling ISS Insurance. Have a good day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "dialogue": "Right. Bye."
