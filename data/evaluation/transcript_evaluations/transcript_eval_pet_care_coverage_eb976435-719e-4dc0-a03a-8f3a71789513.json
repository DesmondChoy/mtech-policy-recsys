      "customer_quote": "[14] Yes, that's important. I need clarity on the Trip Cancellation benefit. What constitutes a 'covered reason'? I assume serious illness or injury of a traveller, or perhaps a close family member back home, are standard triggers, but I'd like confirmation on the general scope outlined in the policy wording. I'm not concerned about work reasons or changing my mind, just the typical insurable events.",

      "customer_quote": "[16] Regarding Travel Delays, I see policies usually cover accommodation or meals after a certain number of hours, like 6 or 8 hours. Can you confirm the typical threshold? More importantly, I have a specific, non-standard requirement here. If our return journey to Singapore is significantly delayed... I need coverage for additional pet accommodation costs.",

      "agent_performance_justification": "The agent explicitly acknowledged both the standard travel delay query and the specific, non-standard requirement regarding pet hotel fees, confirming understanding.",
