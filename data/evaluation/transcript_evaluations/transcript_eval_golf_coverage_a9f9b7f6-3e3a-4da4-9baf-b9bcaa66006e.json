      "customer_quote": "[32] What about trip cancellation? Let's say one of us gets properly sick before we go, or maybe a parent back home falls seriously ill. What are the *exact* covered reasons? I bet 'changing your mind' or 'work called me back' isn't covered, right? But serious illness should be.",

They also specifically asked about declaring a pre-existing condition (high blood pressure) and its impact on claims.",
      "customer_quote": "[26] Now, the usual stuff people worry about. What about medical emergencies? If something serious happens, not just a graze, I mean needing a doctor or hospital in Australia? How comprehensive is that *really*? Are there hidden limits? \n[28] And one of us has high blood pressure. Stable, managed, but it's there. Do we *have* to declare that? Is that just an excuse for you to deny a claim later, even if it's completely unrelated, like a fall?",

You require details on the extent of medical coverage, including emergencies, hospital stays, doctor visits, and prescription costs while overseas. \n[29] Noted. You have a query regarding the declaration of pre-existing conditions, specifically high blood pressure, and require understanding of how it impacts coverage. \n[30] Are there any specific medical equipment needs for the trip, like a CPAP machine or wheelchair?"

      "customer_quote": "[36] Okay, one last thing. Travel delays. Flights get delayed all the time. If we're stuck at an airport for hours, or miss a connecting flight because the first leg was late, does the insurance actually help cover extra hotel nights or meals? Or is the minimum delay like 12 hours before anything kicks in?",

They also explicitly asked for clarification on whether golf falls under standard 'Sports and Adventure' coverage.",
      "customer_quote": "[14] It's primarily a golf trip. That's the main thing. And regarding that, I have very specific requirements... \n[16] First, my golf equipment... I need proper coverage if it gets lost or damaged... actual replacement value. \n[18] Second, green fees... I expect reimbursement for those unused fees. \n[20] Third, golf buggies. If I accidentally damage one... does your insurance cover that liability...? \n[22] And one more thing for golf... a benefit... if you score a hole-in-one. \n[24] So, this standard 'Sports and Adventure' cover people talk about, does golf fall under that, or is it separate? I need clarity.",
      "agent_performance": "PASS",

Reimbursement for unused green fees due to inability to play. \n[21] Okay, coverage for accidental damage to a rented golf buggy. \n[23] Acknowledged. Requirement for a hole-in-one benefit during the trip... Are there any other activities planned besides golf? Like scuba diving or anything adventurous? \n[25] Okay, noted... you need clarity on how it's covered, potentially outside a standard adventure rider unless specifically needed for the golf aspects. I've noted your requirement for sports coverage clarification specifically for golf."
