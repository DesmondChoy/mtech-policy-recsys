COVERAGE: Trip Cancellation
RESULT: PASS
JUSTIFICATION: The customer explicitly stated the need for trip cancellation coverage and provided specific covered reasons (serious illness, family emergency) while excluding others (change of mind).
CUSTOMER QUOTE: "[12] Obviously! If one of us gets seriously ill, or there’s a family emergency back home, we’d have to cancel. I’m not throwing away thousands of dollars because of that. Your policy needs to cover cancellation for proper reasons, none of this ‘change of mind’ rubbish."
AGENT PERFORMANCE: PASS
AGENT JUSTIFICATION: The agent directly probed for cancellation concerns and accurately confirmed the customer's requirement.
AGENT QUOTE: "[11] What about circumstances that might cause you to cancel the trip beforehand? Are there any particular concerns there? 
[13] Understood, cover for trip cancellation due to unforeseen events like illness or family emergencies. Noted."

COVERAGE: Medical Coverage
RESULT: PASS
JUSTIFICATION: The customer explicitly mentioned a pre-existing condition (wife's high blood pressure) requiring coverage and also potential injuries from activities.
CUSTOMER QUOTE: "[8] And my wife has high blood pressure. You need to make sure that’s covered, no excuses. 
[10] If I fall and break something, I expect ISS to cover it fully, including getting me off a mountain if necessary."

COVERAGE: Lost/Damaged Luggage
RESULT: PASS
JUSTIFICATION: The customer clearly stated the need for coverage against lost, damaged, and delayed luggage, specifying concerns about replacement value, electronics, and immediate funds for essentials during delays.
CUSTOMER QUOTE: "[14] Absolutely. Airlines lose things, things get damaged. I expect full replacement value if my suitcase is lost or destroyed. And that includes my electronics inside it... And if it's delayed, I expect money to buy essentials immediately, not after some ridiculous waiting period."
AGENT PERFORMANCE: PASS
AGENT JUSTIFICATION: The agent specifically asked about luggage concerns and confirmed the requirement, noting the specific mention of contents.

COVERAGE: Travel Delays
RESULT: PASS
JUSTIFICATION: The customer mentioned concerns about delays early on, citing past experiences with costs, and later linked potential return delays to specific additional costs (pet accommodation).
CUSTOMER QUOTE: "[4] And frankly, with the state of airports lately, I need to know I'm covered if there are ridiculous delays. Last time we were stuck for hours, cost us a fortune in food. 
[16] If my flight back to Singapore is seriously delayed... I expect *you* to cover the extra nights I’ll have to pay for her at the pet hotel."
AGENT PERFORMANCE: PASS
AGENT JUSTIFICATION: The agent acknowledged the initial concern about delays and included coverage for additional expenses due to delays in the final summary.
AGENT QUOTE: "[17] ...cover for Travel Delays causing additional expenses..."

COVERAGE: Sports and Adventure Activities
RESULT: PASS
JUSTIFICATION: The customer specified potential activities (skiing, hiking) and the need for coverage related to potential injuries and evacuation.

AGENT PERFORMANCE: PASS
AGENT JUSTIFICATION: The agent directly asked about adventurous activities and confirmed the requirement.
AGENT QUOTE: "[9] Could you share what sort of activities you might be planning during your trip? Anything adventurous? 
[11] Right, so coverage for some sports and adventure activities like skiing and hiking is needed. I've made a note of that."

COVERAGE: Pet Accommodation Costs (Scenario Specific)
RESULT: PASS
JUSTIFICATION: The customer explicitly stated the scenario-specific requirement for coverage of additional pet accommodation costs due to potential return travel delays.
CUSTOMER QUOTE: "[16] Yes, actually... If my flight back to Singapore is seriously delayed – which seems likely these days – I expect *you* to cover the extra nights I’ll have to pay for her at the pet hotel. This *must* be included."
AGENT PERFORMANCE: PASS
AGENT JUSTIFICATION: The agent asked a general probing question which elicited this specific need, and then explicitly acknowledged and included this unique requirement in the summary.
AGENT QUOTE: "[15] Are there any other specific situations or potential expenses you're concerned about and want to ensure are noted? 
[17] Okay, sir. I have noted your specific requirement for coverage of additional pet accommodation costs in the event your return travel is delayed."
