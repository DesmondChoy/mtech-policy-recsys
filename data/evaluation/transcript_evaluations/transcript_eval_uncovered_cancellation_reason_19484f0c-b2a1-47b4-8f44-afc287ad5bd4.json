The agent used effective probing questions (regarding pre-existing conditions, activities, luggage, and delays) to elicit detailed information when the customer didn't volunteer it initially. The agent also correctly captured the scenario-specific requirement under Trip Cancellation. The final summary accurately reflected the customer's needs. Overall, excellent performance in requirement gathering."
