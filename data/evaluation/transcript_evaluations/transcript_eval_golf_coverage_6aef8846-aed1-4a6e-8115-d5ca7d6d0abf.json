And what happens if I twist my ankle and can't play the rounds I've already paid for? I expect **reimbursement for unused green fees**. Also, those golf buggies can be tricky; what if I accidentally **damage one? Is that covered**? And, call me optimistic, but is there any kind of **benefit if I actually score a hole-in-one** during the trip?",

So, just to clarify those specific requirements for your golf activities: protection for your golf equipment, reimbursement for pre-paid green fees if you're unable to play due to injury or illness, cover for accidental damage liability for a rented golf buggy, and a defined benefit payout for achieving a hole-in-one. Have I captured those golf-related needs correctly? \n[13] And just to confirm, are there any other specific sports or adventure activities planned besides golf?"

The agent effectively used clarifying questions and summarization to ensure all points were captured accurately, despite the customer's initial frustration. Excellent performance in information gathering."
