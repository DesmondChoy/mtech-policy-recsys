SUMMARY:
Requirements Met: 3/5
Overall Assessment: The agent successfully identified the need for all five standard coverage types, either through customer initiation or agent probing. The agent performed well in gathering crucial details for Medical Coverage (pre-existing conditions) and Sports Activities (skiing). However, the agent failed to gather specific details for Lost/Damaged Luggage and Travel Delays beyond the customer's initial general statement, missing opportunities to understand specific concerns or potential exclusions.
