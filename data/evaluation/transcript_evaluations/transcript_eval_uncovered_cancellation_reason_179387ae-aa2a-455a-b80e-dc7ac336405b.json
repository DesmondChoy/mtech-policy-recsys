Crucially, the customer also detailed the scenario-specific requirement: needing to know if cancelling for a sister's wedding (an important family event) would be covered [26]. This provided specific details beyond a general request.",
      "customer_quote": "[24] And... fingers crossed nothing happens, but what if we have to cancel the whole trip beforehand? Like, if someone gets seriously ill or something major happens? Trip Cancellation cover is standard, right? [26] Ah, but here's a specific one I need to ask about. My sister, right, she just announced her wedding date, and it *might* clash with our travel dates... if it turns out we absolutely have to be back for her big day, and we have to cancel the Japan trip because of it... is that covered? I need to know if I'm covered if I have to cancel my trip for my sister's wedding, it's a really important family event.",

      "agent_performance_justification": "The agent acknowledged the standard Trip Cancellation requirement [25] and specifically addressed the customer's query about the wedding, correctly noting it as a specific requirement needing clarification rather than confirming coverage prematurely [27].",
      "agent_quote": "[25] Yes, Trip Cancellation coverage for certain specified reasons like serious illness is a common feature. I've noted that down. [27] Okay, I understand. So, you have a specific requirement to understand if cancelling the trip due to a family event like your sister's wedding would be covered under Trip Cancellation. I have noted this specific query down. Typically, reasons like changing plans for events might fall under exclusions, but I have noted it as a requirement you need clarity on."

Details regarding pre-existing conditions and medical equipment were also gathered.",
      "customer_quote": "[18] Well, obviously, the main thing is if one of us gets sick or has an accident, right? You hear stories... need to make sure hospital stays or seeing a doctor over there won't cost us an arm and a leg. So, definitely need solid Medical Coverage. Very important. [12] No, no pre-existing conditions. [14] Nope, nothing like that needed.",
