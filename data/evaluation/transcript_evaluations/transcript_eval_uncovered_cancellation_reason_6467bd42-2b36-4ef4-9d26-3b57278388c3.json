This meets the requirement of mentioning the coverage type and providing specific details, including the scenario-specific requirement.",
      "customer_quote": "[20] Yes! This is the big one... the reason I'm so stressed. We have to be back by a certain date because... look, I need to know if I'm covered if I have to cancel my trip for my sister's wedding. It's right after we're due back, and if *anything* prevents me from being there... family emergency, you know? It's non-negotiable. Is that covered? Cancelling because I absolutely *have* to be at the wedding?",

      "agent_performance_justification": "The agent acknowledged the customer's specific cancellation concern (sister's wedding), correctly identified it as a trip cancellation query, and appropriately noted that it might typically be an exclusion but recorded it as a specific requirement needing clarification.",
      "agent_quote": "[21] Okay, I understand. So, you require information on trip cancellation coverage, and specifically need to know if cancelling due to needing to attend a significant family event, like your sister's wedding, would be a covered reason. I must note that cancellation for reasons like a pre-planned family event might typically fall under exclusions for standard trip cancellation, but I've recorded it as a specific requirement you need clarification on."

[15] Are there any pre-existing medical conditions for either traveller that we should be aware of when looking at options? [17] And just to check, are there any special medical equipment needs...?"
