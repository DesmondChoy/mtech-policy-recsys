However, the agent failed to probe for necessary details for the standard coverage types (Trip Cancellation, Medical, Luggage, Travel Delays). While the *need* for these coverages was captured, the lack of specific details means the gathered information is incomplete according to the evaluation criteria, potentially leading to a quote that doesn't fully align with the customer's specific concerns or needs within those broad categories. Agent performance was adequate in confirming stated needs but poor in eliciting crucial details for standard coverages."
