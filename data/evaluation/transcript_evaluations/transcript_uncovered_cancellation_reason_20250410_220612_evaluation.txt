COVERAGE: Trip Cancellation
RESULT: PASS
JUSTIFICATION: The customer explicitly requested trip cancellation coverage, mentioning standard reasons like illness or family emergencies, and also brought up the scenario-specific requirement of needing to cancel for a sister's wedding.
CUSTOMER QUOTE: "[16] Oh yes, absolutely! ... Like if one of us gets really sick, or heaven forbid, something happens to family back home. That kind of thing. So, yes, trip cancellation cover is definitely needed. But actually, Priya, I have a specific worry... My sister is planning her wedding... If it does, I absolutely have to cancel the trip... Would the insurance cover cancellation for something like that, attending a close family wedding?"
AGENT PERFORMANCE: PASS
AGENT JUSTIFICATION: The agent proactively asked about cancellation concerns and specifically acknowledged and recorded the customer's unique requirement regarding the wedding, correctly noting it might require specific policy checks.
AGENT QUOTE: "[15] And what about before the trip? Sometimes things come up unexpectedly. Are you concerned about situations that might force you to cancel the trip beforehand? [17] Okay, so you require coverage for trip cancellation due to standard reasons like illness, injury, or family emergencies. And thank you for mentioning the specific scenario about your sister's potential wedding date clash. I've noted that as a specific requirement you need cover for – cancellation due to needing to attend an important family event like a wedding. I should mention that cancellation for events like weddings might not always be standard, but I have recorded it clearly as one of your requirements to check against policy options."

COVERAGE: Medical Coverage
RESULT: PASS
JUSTIFICATION: The customer emphasized the need for medical coverage, specifically mentioning concerns related to a pre-existing condition (husband's high blood pressure) and the need for coverage for treatment, doctor visits, medication, and potential hospital stays.
CUSTOMER QUOTE: "[14] Ah, good you asked! Yes, my husband has high blood pressure. It's well-managed with medication, but you never know... So, proper medical coverage is really important. If something happens, God forbid, we need to know we can get treatment, see a doctor, get medicine, maybe even if it means a hospital stay, without worrying about a massive bill. That's probably the top priority, actually."
AGENT PERFORMANCE: PASS
AGENT JUSTIFICATION: The agent appropriately probed for pre-existing medical conditions, which directly led to the customer detailing their specific medical coverage requirements.
AGENT QUOTE: "[13] And on the topic of medical things... are there any pre-existing medical conditions we should be aware of for either traveler? ... [15] Understood. So, comprehensive medical coverage for emergencies during the trip is a key requirement, bearing in mind the declared high blood pressure for one traveler."

COVERAGE: Lost/Damaged Luggage
RESULT: PASS
JUSTIFICATION: The customer explicitly stated the need for coverage for lost and damaged luggage, providing an anecdote about a cousin's lost bag and mentioning concerns about damaged bags.
CUSTOMER QUOTE: "[10] And luggage! Don't get me started on luggage... My cousin flew to Europe last year, and her bag decided to take a detour... Didn't see it for days! Had to buy all new clothes. Nightmare! So, coverage for lost bags is a must. Or damaged ones too, sometimes they come off the belt looking like they fought a tiger."
AGENT PERFORMANCE: PASS
AGENT JUSTIFICATION: The agent acknowledged the customer's requirement for lost, damaged, and delayed baggage coverage after the customer brought it up.
AGENT QUOTE: "[11] Okay, noted. Coverage for lost, damaged, or delayed baggage, including reimbursement for necessary purchases if it's delayed beyond a certain point. Makes sense."

COVERAGE: Travel Delays
RESULT: PASS
JUSTIFICATION: The customer specifically requested coverage for travel delays, citing a past negative experience and mentioning the need for coverage for associated expenses like hotels and food.
CUSTOMER QUOTE: "[8] ...last time we went to Bangkok, our flight back was delayed by nearly 8 hours! Stuck at the airport, terrible! So, definitely need something that covers us if that happens again – you know, for hotels or food if we get stuck."
AGENT PERFORMANCE: PASS
AGENT JUSTIFICATION: The agent confirmed understanding of the requirement for significant travel delay coverage, including accommodation and meal expenses.
AGENT QUOTE: "[9] Right, I understand. Delays can certainly be inconvenient. So you're looking for coverage for significant travel delays, including expenses like accommodation and meals if incurred due to the delay?"

COVERAGE: Sports and Adventure Activities
RESULT: PASS
JUSTIFICATION: The customer mentioned potential participation in skiing and light hiking, expressing a need for coverage related to 'adventurous stuff', specifically mentioning the possibility of injury during skiing.
CUSTOMER QUOTE: "[12] Activities... hmm. ... My husband was muttering something about trying skiing near Mount Fuji... So, maybe something that covers adventurous stuff? Just in case he breaks a leg showing off, haha! ... possibly that one skiing attempt."
AGENT PERFORMANCE: PASS
AGENT JUSTIFICATION: The agent proactively asked about planned activities and then confirmed the need for coverage related to potential sports activities like skiing, including medical expenses.
AGENT QUOTE: "[11] Are there any particular activities you might be planning in Japan? Sometimes specific activities require different considerations. [13] Alright, so potential participation in some sports or adventure activities like skiing. We should note the need for coverage related to medical expenses or assistance arising from specified activities like that."
