    "overall_assessment": "The agent successfully gathered information on all five required coverage types. Despite the customer's initial rush, the agent systematically probed for each coverage area, elicited specific needs and details from the customer (e.g., types of medical cover, reasons for cancellation, specific activity), and asked relevant clarifying questions (e.g., pre-existing conditions). The agent confirmed all gathered requirements effectively at the end. Excellent performance in coverage information gathering."
