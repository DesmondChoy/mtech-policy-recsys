We\u2019d lose thousands on flights and hotels. Is there protection for that, or is it just 'tough luck'? What reasons for cancellation are actually accepted?",

      "agent_performance_justification": "The agent acknowledged the customer's need and the specific examples provided, confirming it as a requirement.",

      "agent_quote": "[15] Regarding medical aspects, are there any pre-existing medical conditions we should be aware of, like asthma or high blood pressure? \n[17] Okay, I've noted the requirement for clarity on coverage related to pre-existing high blood pressure and the need for general medical coverage for illness or injury during the trip."

Extra days mean extra costs. I need to know if the insurance will cover those additional kennel fees. Don't just give me a vague answer, is that specific cost covered?",
