However, it fails validation because the justification for the Hole-in-One benefit being 'Partially Met' due to a 'competition' clause is not supported by the provided PDF summary table, and this unsupported claim is repeated in the summary weaknesses. Additionally, while pre-existing conditions are covered under Evacuation (Sec 4), the lack of mention under main Medical Expenses (Sec 2) and the contradictory declaration on page 7 warrant the 'purchase of add-on required' flag as per instructions."
