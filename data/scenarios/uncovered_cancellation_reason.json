    "Coverage if I have to cancel my trip for an important family event, like my sister's wedding."

  "prompt_instructions": "The customer should explicitly ask about coverage for trip cancellation due to a personal family event, providing specific details (e.g., 'I need to know if I'm covered if I have to cancel my trip for my sister's wedding'). The agent should clearly acknowledge this specific request, note it as a requirement, and indicate that this might not be a standard covered reason for cancellation."
