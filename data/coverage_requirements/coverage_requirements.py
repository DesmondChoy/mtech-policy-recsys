Coverage Requirements Dictionary

This module defines the standard coverage requirements for travel insurance policies.
These requirements represent the most critical coverage types that customers look for
when selecting travel insurance.

This dictionary is used for:
1. Generating synthetic transcripts
2. Evaluating if transcripts were generated correctly
3. Providing a reference for policy analysis
