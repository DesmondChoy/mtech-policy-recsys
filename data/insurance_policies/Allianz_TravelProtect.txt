## ALLIANZ TRAVEL PROTECT SINGLE TRIP POLICY WORDING

## 1 IMPORTANT MATTERS

## WHO IS YOUR INSURER?

This policy  is  underwritten  by  Allianz  Insurance  Singapore Pte. Ltd.,  as  the insurer.  The insurer  may  be referred  to as  'we',  'our' and 'us' in  this policy  wording.

AWP Services Singapore Pte. Ltd. (operating under the consumerfacing  branding  of  Allianz  Travel) has  been appointed  by  Allianz Insurance Singapore Pte. Ltd.,  to provide  service assistance  on our behalf.

## WHAT THIS POLICY INCLUDES

This document  is our  Allianz Travel  Protect  single trip policy wording.

This travel insurance policy covers only the sudden and unexpected specific  situations,  events,  and  losses  included  in  this policy,  and  only  under  the terms  and  conditions described.  Not every  loss is covered,  even  if  it  is due  to  something  sudden, unexpected,  or  out  of your  control.  The  event  that  leads  to you claim  must occur while your policy  is  in effect.

You need to read this policy  carefully  and  note the exclusions  in each section  along  with the General  Exclusions to make sure you understand it and ensure that it meets your needs.

If you  need  any  clarification on your  coverage  or our  Policy Wording,  please  contact our  Customer Care  Team at +65 6222 1919

Your policy  consists  of  three parts:

- 1. The Policy  Wording;  and
- 2. The Certificate of  Insurance;  and
- 3. Any other document we tell you  forms  part  of your  policy.

Please retain these documents in a safe place.

## WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO BE INSURED  ON THIS POLICY?

You are eligible  for  this policy  if you meet the following  criteria:

- a) you are ordinarily  Singapore  resident;  and
- b) you will purchase your policy  in Singapore  before you start your trip;
- c) you intend to return to Singapore  after your trip;  and
- d) the departure date on your policy  reflects the date you are originally  scheduled  to begin your travel, as  shown  on your travel itinerary.

<!-- image -->

The policy is  issued  in Singapore  and is subject to the Insurance Act 1996 (the 'Act')  and  all  rules,  regulations,  subsidiary legislation and government orders enacted thereunder. The Act provides  that you are treated as  being  ordinarily  resident in Singapore  if:

- a) You are a citizen  of Singapore,  unless you have  resided outside  Singapore  continuously  for 5 or more years preceding the application  date of the policy  and  are not currently residing  in  Singapore;
- b) You are a permanent resident, unless you have resided in Singapore  for less than a total of  183 days  in the 12 months preceding the application  date of the policy;
- c) You have a work pass or permit required under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act 1990, unless you have resided  in Singapore  for less than a total of  183 days  in the 12 months preceding the application  date of the policy; or
- d) You have a pass  or permit required  under the Immigration Act 1959 that has  duration  longer than 90 days  and you have resided  in Singapore  continuously  for at least 90 days in the 12 months preceding  the application  date of the policy.

If you do not satisfy  any  one of  the aforesaid  definitions  of  being 'ordinarily  resident in Singapore', you must notify us immediately.

The insurance  will  be invalid  if we have  previously  informed you that we do not want to insure you (anymore). In this  case, we will refund  any premium paid  by you.

If requested  by us, you  will  need  to  prove your  eligibility by providing us with documentation including  but not limited to:

- (i) a copy  of your passport;  or
- (ii) Singapore  residency  documents;  or
- (iii) a copy  of your current visa;  or
- (iv) other official  documents confirming your right to reside  in Singapore;  and
- (v) a copy  of your travel itinerary.

## PAYMENT  BEFORE  COVER WARRANTY

In the event that the total premium  due is  not  paid  to the Insurer (or the intermediary  through whom this  Policy was  effected) on or before  the inception  date then the insurance  shall  not attach and no  benefits whatsoever  shall  be  payable by  the  Insurer. Any payment  received thereafter shall  be  of  no  effect  whatsoever  as cover has  not attached.

Your policy  is  effective at 00:00 (SGT) on the day after you pay  the full  premium.  Cover  is  only  provided  for  events  that  occur  while your policy  is  in effect.

## CANCELLATION  DURING  COOLING-OFF  PERIOD

If you  are  not  completely  satisfied with the  extent  of cover provided  by  this  policy, you may  cancel this  policy  within  14 days after you are issued  with your Certificate  of Insurance. You will be given  a  full  refund  of  the premium you have  paid,  provided you have not started your trip and you do  not wish  to make  a claim or exercise any other right under the policy.

After the cooling-off  period you can still cancel your policy  but we will not refund any  part of your premium  if you do.

## EMERGENCY  ASSISTANCE

If during your trip you are to be hospitalised,  require evacuation  or repatriation services, need to make alternative travel or accommodation  arrangements or have lost your baggage,  travel documents or money, please notify us as soon as possible.

We  provide our  customers with easy access to our  24-hour emergency assistance  service.  A phone call will put you  directly in touch with a medical  or travel specialist  who  will be able  to assist you and confirm the cover available  under your policy. You will be advised  of any steps you will need to follow in claiming  under your policy. You  can  call  collect  from anywhere  in  the  world  for emergency medical and travel assistance.

## WHEN WE MAY CANCEL THIS POLICY

We may cancel this policy  in the following  circumstances  only,  by giving you 14 days  prior  notice  by  email  sent  to your  last  known email  address  supplied  to us:

- a) If you fail  to comply  with your  duty of utmost good  faith;
- b) If you fail  to comply  with a provision  of this policy,  including a provision  relating  to the payment  of the premium;
- c) If you make a fraudulent claim under this policy.

## CORRECTNESS  OF STATEMENTS  AND FRAUD

If any  claim  under this policy  is  in any  respect fraudulent,  or if any false  declaration  is  made  or false  or incorrect information  is  used in support of any claim,  then we can, at our sole discretion,  not pay your claim and cancel your cover under this policy from the date that the incorrect statement or fraudulent  claim  was  made.

## DUTY OF DISCLOSURE

When  you  apply  for  insurance  or  alter  this policy, you  must disclose  to us  all  material  facts.  A  material  fact  is  one  that may influence  a  prudent  insurer  in  deciding  whether  or not  to accept the cover  and,  if  so,  on  what  terms and  conditions  and  for  what premium.

Examples of information you may need to disclose  include:

- · anything  that increases  the risk  of  an  insurance claim;
- · any  criminal  conviction subject  to Singapore law;
- · if  another  insurer  has  cancelled  or refused  to insure  or renew insurance, has  imposed  special  terms,  or refused any  claim;
- · any  insurance  claim  or  loss  made  or  suffered  in  the past.

These  examples  are  a  guide  only.  If  there  is  any  doubt  as  to whether any particular piece of information  needs to be disclosed, this should  be referred to us.

<!-- image -->

If you fail  to comply  with your  duty of disclosure  it may  result in:

- · this  policy  being  avoided retrospectively with  the effect that the  policy  never  existed;
- · this  policy  being  cancelled;
- · the amount  we pay  if  you  make  a  claim  being  reduced;  or
- · us  refusing to pay  a  claim.

## CHANGE  OF CIRCUMSTANCES

During  the period  of insurance, you must tell  us immediately  of any material  change  in  the  circumstances  surrounding the  subject matter of this  insurance  that:

- · increases the risk we are insuring, or
- · alters  the nature  of  the risk we are insuring.

Once you have told us, we may immediately  change the terms of this  policy  or  cancel  it.  If you fail  to  tell us, we may  apply  these changes retrospectively from the date you ought to have reasonably  told us.

## CHOICE OF LAW

This  policy  is  governed  by  and  construed  in  accordance  with  the laws  of  Singapore. You  agree  that  it  is your  intention  that  this Choice of  Law clause  applies.

## SANCTIONS  REGULATION

No insurer  shall  be  deemed to provide  cover and  no  insurer  shall be liable to pay  any  claim or provide  any benefit  hereunder to the extent that the provision  of  such  cover,  payment  of  such  claim  or provision of such benefit would expose  that  Insurer  to  any sanction, prohibition or restriction under United Nations resolutions  or the trade or economic sanctions,  laws or regulations of the  European  Union, Singapore, United  States  of  America and/or any other applicable  national  economic or trade sanction law or regulations.

## CLERICAL ERROR

A  clerical  error  by  AWP  Services  Singapore Pte.  Ltd  or  Allianz Insurance  Singapore  Pte. Ltd.,  shall  not  invalidate an  insurance which is otherwise  validly  in force,  nor would  it continue  insurance otherwise not validly  in force.

## DISPUTE  RESOLUTION  PROCESS

Any dispute about any matter  arising under, out  of, or in connection with  this  policy  shall  first  be referred  to the Financial Industry Disputes  Resolution  Centre Ltd ('FIDReC'). This applies  as long  as  the dispute  can  be  brought  before  FIDReC.  If the dispute cannot be referred to or resolved by FIDReC,  it shall be referred to and  finally  resolved  by  arbitration  in  Singapore  in  accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration  Centre ('SIAC Rules') for the time being  in force, which rules  are deemed  to be  incorporated  by  reference  in  this  clause. The tribunal  shall  consist  of one (1) arbitrator.

## EXCLUSION  OF RIGHTS UNDER  CONTRACTS  (RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES)  ACT

Any person or entity who is not a party to this policy  shall  have no rights  under the Contracts (Right of Third  Parties) Act 2001

to enforce any  terms of the policy.

## POLICY OWNERS  PROTECTION  SCHEME

This policy is protected  under  the  Policy  Owners' Protection Scheme which is administered  by the Singapore Deposit Insurance Corporation  (SDIC).  Coverage  for  the policy  is  automatic  and  no further action is  required.

All  information will be  treated  as confidential  and  protected to the full extent under law.
