## What you should know

You can only claim under one of the following benefits for the same event, but not under more than one benefit:

If this is a single trip policy, the policy will end when either the Trip cancellation and loss of deposit benefit or Trip postponement benefit is paid.

- Trip cancellation and loss of deposit;

- Travel delay;
- Missed connections;
- Trip disruption;
- Insolvency protection;

We will pay the benefit that gives the highest benefit amount, provided that you have advised the travel agent, tour operator, transport or accommodation providers and us as soon as possible after learning of a potential need to make a claim.

You must have also asked for a refund of any prepaid expenses from the travel agent, tour operator, transport or accommodation providers first. We will reduce your claim by the amount they have refunded you. This is regardless of the form of refund which can include, but is not limited to cash, vouchers, credits and re-booking options.

- any claims for Trip cancellation and loss of deposit benefit and Trip postponement benefit if you buy your policy less than 72 hours before your scheduled departure from Singapore;

- any claims that result from your pre-booked flight being cancelled due to any fault on the airline's part such as aircrew rotation, rescheduled flights, operational requirements or mechanical breakdown of the airplane.

However, despite the above, we will pay for any Trip cancellation and loss of deposit benefit or Trip postponement benefit, if:

- of declared insolvency -whether or not the individual or entity has filed for bankruptcy; or
- a business owner with prior convictions for fraudulent or dishonest acts:

## How we decide how much to pay

- We will not pay more than the original purchase price and will decide whether to replace, repair, or pay a cash amount for the stolen or damaged items.
- We may treat a damaged item as beyond repair. If we do so, we will treat it as lost and we will become the owner of that item.
- We will treat items that are a pair or a set as one item for the purpose of this benefit, and only one amount will be payable for the pair or set.
- We will use the table below as a guide for determining the items' fair value.

- Knowingly send us a forged or false document.

We pay all property claims by applying depreciation based on the proof of purchase. If proof of purchase is not available, we will pay the current market value of the item as determined by us, up to S$50 per item and up to a maximum of 5 items. This means you may not get back the full purchase price. If we assess an item as being beyond repair and pay for its replacement, the damaged item becomes our property. You must keep any damaged property and send it to us if we ask for it. You will need to pay for any postage or transportation cost.

## We only pay reasonable and customary costs

Where we pay for items and services for you or under a benefit, we will only pay the amount that we believe is reasonable and customary for that item or service.

Any penalty charges incurred that would not have been imposed had you notified the travel agent, tour operator, transport or accommodation provider and us within the specified period in the event of a claim will not be covered.

## If you have more than one travel policy with FWD

If you have more than one policy with us that covers the same benefit, you will only be able to claim benefits from one policy. If the benefit amounts are different under your different policies, we will pay the highest benefit amount.

## Pre-existing medical condition

Refers to a medical condition:

- you were aware of, or could reasonably be expected to be aware of, before the start of your trip; or
- you received (or were advised to get) medical advice, tests, treatment, diagnosis, or prescription drugs during the 12 months before the start of your trip.

For an annual plan, any medical condition for which a claim has been made for a previous trip will also be deemed as a pre-existing medical condition for any future trips.

In relation to Trip cancellation and loss of deposit benefit and Trip postponement benefit, any new medical condition that first starts or occurs or is contracted 30 or fewer days before your scheduled departure date will not be considered as a preexisting medical condition.

This applies to you, your family member and your travel companion.

Reasonable transport expenses (for air, sea or land travel) and accommodation expenses together with any administrative fees incurred by you to make the trip after postponing the original trip.

Includes modes of transports like planes, buses, ferries and trains that are pre-booked, where advanced booking or reservation of your seats are required. They must be run by a licensed carrier or operator to carry fare-paying passengers, and must operate on a schedule with specific and pre-defined routes and timings set by the operator. This excludes any taxis, private hire vehicles, or any other ride-hailing or on-demand services, as well as transportation privately arranged for tours.
